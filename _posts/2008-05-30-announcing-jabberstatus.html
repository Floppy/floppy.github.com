Twitter, while it has its problems, does one thing very well. The IM interface allows you to update your status via a Jabber account, which just makes it <em>so</em> easy to do. Facebook, on the other hand, has no such facility, which is unfortunate because although I like the Facebook service, I hate using the website itself. Yes, OK, you can update your Facebook status via Twitter, but I write different things on Facebook and Twitter, so I didn&#8217;t want to go down that route. So, my solution? Write my own!

<p>
JabberStatus is a simple Ruby script which listens on a Jabber account and updates your Facebook status for you. You add <strong>facebook@jabber.org</strong> to your Jabber contact list, then it says hello and gives you instructions on what to do. You click a couple of URLs to give it access to your Facebook account, and that&#8217;s it! Then you just send it status updates, and it posts them on Facebook for you. It&#8217;s free for anyone to use, so give it a go!

Technically, it&#8217;s pretty cunning though I say so myself. It stores Facebook session data for each person that talks to it in it&#8217;s own Jabber contact list, so no backend database is required. Anyway, it&#8217;s all open source so you can <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/jabberstatus/">take a look yourself</a>. You can even run your own instance of it. It&#8217;s still under development (needs code tidying up, as well as better error handling), but it&#8217;s out there working now, so have a go.
