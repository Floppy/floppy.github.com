Well, Saturday was <a href="http://www.geekyoto.com/">geeKyoto 08</a> in London, and I finally had to get round to writing my presentation. Had to finish it on the train on the way in, hoping I wouldn&#8217;t run the laptop battery down too much in case I had to use it during the talk.

It was a great day though! The speakers were incredibly varied, from <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22alex+haw%22+atmos">Alex Haw</a>, an architect/artist who has more ideas in a second than I do in a year, to a great presentation by Gavin Starks about <a href="http://www.amee.cc">AMEE</a>, to a design student who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDqbb0eHVXA">hung a swing in a bus stop</a> (which got the day&#8217;s most spontaneous round of applause). The whole thing was then rounded off by <a href="http://www.bensaunders.com">Ben Saunders</a>, an arctic explorer who has really seen the ice melting up there. Add onto that a fascinating post-conference pub session, and you can&#8217;t lose. The day left me so energised and full of ideas. Now I just need to decide which to attack first!

Hopefully my talk ("Can software save the world?" - pretentious title intentional) will be up online soon. For those of you who saw my talk but didn&#8217;t get the links down, here they are again:
