<p>The last week has been an interesting one for online energy  monitoring. Not content with deprecating Powermeter a few weeks ago,  Google decided to <a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/google-pulls-the-plug-on-powermeter-energy-tool">properly kill it off.</a> And then, as if to say &#8216;us too!' (as they did with the initial launch), Microsoft <a href="http://blog.microsoft-hohm.com/news/11-06-30/Microsoft_Hohm_Service_Discontinuation.aspx">killed Hohm</a>.</p>
<p>Both these efforts were unsuccessful because the companies that put  them out weren't serious about them. There is a place for  experimentation, but if you're a massive company, even your small  experiments seem larger than other people's entire companies. By  half-heartedly grabbing the attention around energy monitoring, these  experiments crowded out the people who are building a business around  this, like <a href="http://www.currentcost.com">Currentcost</a>, <a href="http://www.enio.co.uk">Enio</a>, <a href="http://pachube.com">Pachube</a> and many more.</p>
<p>The fact is that online energy monitoring is not dead - the demise of  these services will simply provide more room for other companies to  innovate without being stepped on. Neither Powermeter or Hohm were doing  anything particularly innovative that hadn't been done many times  before anyway! Powermeter also suffered from being a silo of data, not a  hub. You could put data in, but not get it out, which is a bit  pointless. A truly useful service in this space needs to act as an  aggregator, letting data flow through it so that other innovations can  cluster around it, like the <a href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2011/04/20/the-social-meter">Social Meter</a> project, for instance.</p>
<p>Innovation needs openness, and by smothering a potentially innovative  space with their distinctly non-innovative services, MS and Google did  nobody any favours. We are better off without them.</p>
