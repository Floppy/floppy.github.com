<p>
My MythTV box was changing channels a bit slowly, so with pointers from <a href="http://mezzanines.blogspot.com/">Wilf</a>, I've hacked the Sky Digibox channel change script from <a href="http://www.nexusuk.org/projects/mythtv/lirc/">The Nexus</a> to send the commands all in one go for (marginally) faster channel changing. It also allows extra options to the irsend command. Download the updated version below.
