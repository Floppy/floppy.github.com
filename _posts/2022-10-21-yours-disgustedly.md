I wrote to my MP again...

Boris's disdain for the law and consitution was bad enough, but then to elect undoubtedly the most incompetent leader we've ever had, and finally finish off the UK's standing in the world? What are your party thinking? What are YOU thinking? How can you stand with these people, how can you take their instructions and toe the party line when that party line is set by obviously completely inept people who seem to have wandered into Westminster by accident and are mainly just confused about where they are.

> 3. Resign the whip and sit as an independent. You should be ashamed of your party and if you have any integrity, I'm honestly not sure how you could remain part of it.

> I have stepped back from active politics in the last few years, because truth and reason have been completely undermined and honestly I don't know how to operate anything I believe in in that environment. But I'm reconsidering; if there's a General Election, I'm sorely tempted to stand again just so I can be on stage with you at a husting and say all this to your face in front of hundreds of people, and demand an answer for them.

> Yours in severe disappointment and anger,

> James Smith
