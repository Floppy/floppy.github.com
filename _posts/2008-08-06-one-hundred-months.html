I just saw the <a href="http://onehundredmonths.org/">One Hundred Months</a> campaign, and decided it was ripe for a bit of automated Twittering. So, 5 minutes hacking and we have <a href="http://twitter.com/100months">One Hundred Months on Twitter</a>. Code (as ever these days) is available from <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/onehundredmonths">GitHub</a>.

I'm amazed by what computers can do sometimes. This one seriously took me longer to publish to the world than to write.
