Well, I finally got round to it. I started developing <a href="http://www.carbondiet.org">The Carbon Diet</a> 2 years ago (had the idea 3 years ago!), and it's finally spread it's wings and joined the world of open source. 
</p>

<p>
After I'd been developing it for a few months, it became obvious that it was never going to be a commercial proposition, so it's been my intention to open it up for a very long time now. However, I was putting it off until "after I get it finished", or "after I tidy up the code", or any number of other reasons. Having a small child puts paid to all those plans, so I've finally bitten the bullet and released my dodgy code to the world as it is, warts and all.
</p>

<p>
The site is built in Rails, but it's pretty creaky. It was originally written in version 1.2 as I was learning, and a lot of the old-style controller and route code is still hanging around, waiting to be improved. I've started, but there is a long way to go to bring it up to a decent standard.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, if you use the site (or not!) and fancy improving it, now you can. Head on over to <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/carbon-diet">github</a> to grab the code and join in. I hope to see you there!
