Unfortunately I couldn’t stay the whole time, but I went along as an <a href="http://www.amee.com">AMEE</a> representative to support other people using our API during the event.  In the quiet periods, I managed to come up with my own hack, which used  GreaseMonkey and AMEE to add carbon emissions to Google Maps.</p>
<p>You can even <a href="http://gist.github.com/185744">get the code</a> and try it yourself. It’s very basic, and actually most of the work was  dealing with Google Maps and making Greasemonkey behave properly - the  AMEE bit, getting the carbon value, was dead easy.</p>
