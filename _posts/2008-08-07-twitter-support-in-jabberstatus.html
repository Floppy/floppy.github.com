<p>
<a href="http://floppy.org.uk/jabberstatus">JabberStatus</a> was originally inspired by Twitter's facility to update your status via XMPP/Jabber. Unfortunately, Twitter's Jabber interface has been down for months now, which is rather sucky. 
</p>

<p>
The solution to this? Extend JabberStatus to work for Twitter as well as Facebook. It turned out to be very easy, so it's online now. Just add twitterstatus@jabber.org to your contact list and it will talk you through the rest.
</p>

<p>
The JabberStatus code has <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/jabberstatus">moved to GitHub</a> now, so you can grab it from there. The <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/climatestats">code for the CO2Updates app</a> has also moved there.
