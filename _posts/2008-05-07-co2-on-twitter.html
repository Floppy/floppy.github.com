I read <a href="http://infovore.org/archives/2008/02/28/making-bridges-talk/">this article</a> last night, about using Twitter to make machines talk, specifically <a href="http://twitter.com/towerbridge">Tower Bridge</a>. "What a fantastic idea", I thought to myself. "Maybe I can do the same thing for climate change". Also, it would be a good way to flex my Ruby muscles a little and get some "fun" coding in for the first time since Amelia was born.

So, a couple of hours of Ruby later, and we have <a href="http://twitter.com/climatestats">atmospheric CO2 updates on Twitter</a>. The code is dead simple, and can be grabbed from <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/climatestats">GitHub</a>.
