I was lucky enough to be invited to talk at the <a href="http://www.rebootbritain.com">Reboot Britain</a> conference on Monday. It was a fascinating day, with lots of inspiring moments. It left me with a feeling that we can make the world a better place if we all get out there and <b>make</b> things. It's something I already believed, but it's great to have a recharge every now and again.

My session was on hacking energy data, kind of a <a href="http://homecamp.org.uk">Homecamp</a> intro for the uninitiated. My slides are up on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Furtive">Slideshare</a>, and embedded here for your viewing pleasure. Hopefully at some point I'll get to re-record the audio and add it in.
