Hurrah, I've just contributed my first code back to the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> project. I've created a workflow for the 0.11 release which adds a simple "testing" state to tickets before they are closed. For the Trac addicts amongst you, it's available at <a href="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TestingWorkflow">Trac Hacks</a>. I'm rather proud of it, because it's actually the first workflow hack on the site!
