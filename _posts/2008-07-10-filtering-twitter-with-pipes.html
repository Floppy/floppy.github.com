<p>
I like <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. I'm not sure why, but I do. However, I don't like the fact that I can't view my friends timeline via RSS without seeing my own updates in there as well. I already know what I've written, I just want to see what other people wrote. To scratch that particular itch, over lunchtime I built a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipe</a> to filter my own updates out of my feed, and you can use it too. Check it out <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/floppy/twitter_filter">here</a>.
