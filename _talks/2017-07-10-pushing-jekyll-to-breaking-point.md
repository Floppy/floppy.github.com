Jekyll is a static web development tool, used by GitHub Pages. Most uses are pretty simple, but you can do a lot more complex things with it too. This talk  explains how Iâ€™ve used git submodules, deeply nested JSON, CSV data, and other techniques to produce complex data-driven sites with rich output, all on GitHub Pages in vanilla Jekyll. It also explains why some of this is a *really* bad idea, and reveal the true horror of some of the code required!
