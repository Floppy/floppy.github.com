The OpenPolitics project is a collaborative political policy-writing platform. Started as an experiment in using open source principles outside the world of tech, itâ€™s grown into a tool (written in Ruby) that allows anyone with a good idea to take a direct role in writing policy. This talk will explain how the project started, how the system evolved, and how it currently works atop git and GitHub to make open source workflows democratic and accessible by non-developers.
