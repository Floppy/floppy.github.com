    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I wrote my blog post <a href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2013/07/05/its-time-to-step-up/">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to step up&rdquo;</a> last summer, I&rsquo;ve got very interested in the concept of Open Democracy, and have been discovering a lot about what&rsquo;s currently going on in this area. This post is an attempt to delineate the various efforts, mainly for my own benefit, but perhaps others may find it useful as well.</p>

<p>There are a number of overlapping concepts. First, we have political parties, with their manifestos. Then we have the idea of a constitution, and finally the policy-making process itself. A few examples:</p>

<h2>Party Manifestos</h2>

<p>Firstly, and most familiar, we have the political party manifesto. My view is that this is a collection of statements that outlines the beliefs of the party, and how it intends to attack problems. It isn&rsquo;t necessarily detailed, or fully costed, but is indicative of the direction that the party wishes to go. The Pirate Party UK will soon be launching their next open manifesto process, and I&rsquo;m experimenting with building a new political platform under the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a> project (an interesting aspect of which is that is designed to deprecate the party system).</p>

<h2>Constitutions</h2>

<p>Then, we have the idea of a constitution. The UK does not have a proper written constitution, but there is a crowdsourcing effort going on at <a href="http://www.constitutionuk.com/">Constitution UK</a> to create one. Interestingly, a lot of ideas that are going into that are ones that I consider far too specific for a constitution, and instead belong in a party manifesto. A consititution should be short, simple, and consist of the basic rules on which we all agree. The constitution can be added to, but it&rsquo;s best to start with something very simple.</p>

<p>Some examples; the structure of Parliament, the role (or lack thereof) of the monarchy, and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">UDHR</a> would belong in a constitution, but things like economic and social policy, including the role of the NHS and welfare state, would not.</p>

<h2>Tenuous Analogies</h2>

<p>To use a computer analogy, if a party manifesto can be considered a piece of software, which the user can choose to run or not, a consitution is more like the OS; a lower-level design that allows the higher-level manifesto to run, and on which all participants in the system agree.</p>

<p>(Obviously, there are many OSes. And we have many countries with different constitutions, so I&rsquo;m sticking with this analogy for now&hellip; let&rsquo;s see where it breaks)</p>

<h2>Open Policy</h2>

<p>Then we have the policy-design level, which is I think what the <a href="http://my.civilservice.gov.uk/policy/">Cabinet Office Open Policy Team</a> is looking at. This is apolitical, driven by the choices made by the electorate, and is about effective implementation of the ideas in a manifesto. In my mind this is like the content that you create using a piece of software. So, it reflects the manifesto commitment used to drive it, but then is richer in terms of how that commitment is implemented, funded, and so on.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The world of Open Democeacy is one with many pieces, and how they all fit together isn&rsquo;t necessarily obvious at the first look. Anyone who wants to contribute to this (including myself) should understand the &lsquo;stack&rsquo; to know which ideas fit where.</p>

<p>And of course, all this could be wrong, it&rsquo;s just my assessment of it. If anyone wants to enlighten me further, please do, and please contribute to all the open democracy efforts that are out there, at whatever level you feel is most appropriate for you.</p>

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2013/10/10/depression-is-a-bug-not-a-feature/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-10T11:02:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2013/10/10/depression-is-a-bug-not-a-feature</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is apparently <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/world-mental-health-day/">World Mental Health Day</a>, which makes it an appropriate time to talk a little about depression. I was thinking of doing this anyway, but today seems a good day to do it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve suffered from intermittent depression for the last few years. If I&rsquo;ve been quiet on Twitter or GitHub for the last couple of weeks, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m currently recovering from my fourth round; they seem to come on just under every two years, it seems. It&rsquo;s not a pleasant thing to admit to, but I honestly believe that only by talking about our experiences can we normalise this, and when you&rsquo;re in the grip of depression, what you really need is to know that you are <em>not alone</em>.</p>

<p>The first time round, I didn&rsquo;t really understand what was happening. Work was stressful, but not ridiculously so, but I lost the ability to cope with it. I couldn&rsquo;t make decisions, and I remember times when I would have to run away and actually <em>hide in a darkened room</em> for a while when something tricky came up like, I dunno, triaging the Monday morning bug list. Fortunately I worked for a flight simulation company at the time, so dark rooms were in plentiful supply.</p>

<p>Depression, for someone who works entirely in their mind, as we do as creative programmers, is utterly debilitating. Imagine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your mind slows down</li>
<li>You lose the ability to focus, or think straight about problems</li>
<li>You lose the ability to make decisions; even deciding on lunch can be impossible</li>
<li>You lose confidence; feel like you&rsquo;re a fraud, and that you&rsquo;ll be found out</li>
<li>You lose the big picture; you can&rsquo;t hold it all in your head</li>
<li>Anxiety builds, and eventually you find yourself hiding in darkened rooms trying not to panic (and often failing)</li>
</ul>


<p>Our jobs depend on those exact qualities, and often, for many of us, so does our self-worth. I try to compare it to being a sportsman and having a broken leg; it&rsquo;s take you out of the game just as surely, and it robs you of your reason for being just as much.</p>

<p>However; it is manageable. I&rsquo;m still learning, but I am getting better at it. I&rsquo;m spotting it earlier each time, am getting better at warning my co-workers, and have no qualms now with going to the doctor and getting the help I need once it becomes clear. I&rsquo;ve had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram">medication</a> the last three times; I&rsquo;m currently a week and a half in to this round.</p>

<p>The important thing to realise that <em>it&rsquo;s not a failing, it&rsquo;s an illness</em>. Your brain is a big bag of chemicals that govern your emotions; there&rsquo;s no magical soul hiding there, I&rsquo;m afraid. But sometimes those chemicals go wrong. In the case of depression, it&rsquo;s apparently a long-term reduction in the amount of Serotonin in the brain that does it. Your synapses hoover up too much, so there&rsquo;s not enough left in the gaps to conduct the signals effectively. It can be brought on by stress, by exhaustion, by sudden shocks, or even by a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; illness. The brain gets out of kilter, and then just gets <em>stuck</em> in this cycle.</p>

<p>But, as an engineer, <em>I can relate to this</em>. Depression is a <em>bug</em>, not a failure on <em>my</em> part. The medication prevents this serotonin reuptake, and lets your brain recover, and remember how to balance itself. I&rsquo;ve proved this to myself time and again; a few days into the medication, I&rsquo;m <em>back</em>. I&rsquo;m me again. For example, I couldn&rsquo;t have written this two days ago, but today I&rsquo;m feeling more&hellip; <em>present</em>. I&rsquo;m not there yet, but it won&rsquo;t be long now.</p>

<p>The people around you have a huge part to play. You need their understanding, support, and for them to give you time to recover. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to cope with this if not for my family, my colleagues at <a href="http://amee.com">AMEE</a> and the <a href="http://www.theodi.org">ODI</a>, and for a great friend of mine who, many years ago, taught me how depression works <em>before</em> I found out for myself.</p>

<p>There are a few links I&rsquo;d recommend reading about this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://revdancatt.com/2012/07/26/leaving-the-guardian-creativity-vs-mild-depression-the-quantified-self-and-running/">Leaving the Guardian, Creativity vs Mild Depression</a> by Rev Dan Catt</li>
<li><a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html">Adventures in Depression</a> and <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/depression-part-two.html">Part 2</a> by Hyperbole and a Half</li>
</ul>


<p>That was a bit long, but the TL;DR is this: If you&rsquo;re feeling the symptoms above, then talk to your doctor and <em>get help</em>. It&rsquo;s just a bug, it&rsquo;s fixable, and you are <em>not</em> a failure. If you know someone who seems to be suffering, then try to help them understand what&rsquo;s happening, don&rsquo;t just tell them to &ldquo;cheer up&rdquo;.</p>

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2013/07/05/its-time-to-step-up/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-05T20:08:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2013/07/05/its-time-to-step-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I find the current state of politics in the UK incredibly depressing.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I find myself disagreeing with most of what the Conservative party is doing in government, and in particular with the narrative they are using to justify it. The Liberal Democrats may claim they have moderated the worst excesses of the Conservatives, but have still allowed the near-privatisation of the NHS, and failed utterly to do anything with the concessions they got in the coalition agreement on things like electoral reform.</p>

<p>On the opposition side&hellip; well, what opposition? I personally like Ed, but it&rsquo;s obvious the media have their teeth into him and will never let him have a proper voice. Worst of all, the Labour Party are buying into the aforementioned narrative of &ldquo;this is what needs to be done&rdquo;. They don&rsquo;t challenge the demonisation of the poor, while entrenched power runs off with the money that&rsquo;s being stripped from our welfare state.</p>

<p>Protest votes are heading to the charismatic far right, with the Old Tory caricatures that are UKIP grabbing all the headlines and dragging the entire country down a path that we <em>really</em> shouldn&rsquo;t be considering. The other minor parties are next to useless. The Greens, really the party I agree with most, will always be mired in 1970&rsquo;s style environmentalism, which nobody will ever vote for en masse.</p>

<p>All this adds up to an uncomfortable truth. Nobody in the public sphere in this country is speaking for <em>me</em>. The narrative is about how the past was better, and the present is broken. The people in power seem to lust after the old days of empire, rather than working out how to take us into a bright shiny future.</p>

<p>The problem is; the future isn&rsquo;t stopping. It will change <em>every single institution we have</em>, and we should be getting excited about that fact and making sure it works <em>for</em> us. That&rsquo;s what I dedicate my life to, to making sure the future is a <em>better</em> place for <em>everyone</em>, but nobody in power seems to want to take us there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2009/11/10/the-activist-geek-philosophy">written before</a> about a kind of shared philosophy amongst the open society community, but I stopped short of some of the more controversial areas of politics. I think it&rsquo;s time for us to stop doing that. There is an unspoken tradition in our community of trying to be beyond political statements, to fix things from the outside, but the way GDS are reforming the civil service (which I <em>will</em> give the Conservatives credit for, or at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Maude">some of them</a>) has reminded me that in order to truly change the system, you sometimes have to <em>become</em> the system.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a general election coming in a couple of years. Those of us who are looking to the future should have our hands in the game. It&rsquo;s time for our community to grow up, take responsibility, and stop leaving the debate to the relics. We have the tools and the skills to do this, and a lot of allies. We&rsquo;re already changing the world from behind the scenes; it&rsquo;s time to start leading from the front as well.</p>

<p>If someone is already doing something about this, I want to know who. If not, we should get started by setting up a GitHub repository, and get collaborating on policy for a brighter future.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[My Mentoring Journey]]></title>
    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2013/06/04/my-mentoring-journey/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-04T20:03:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2013/06/04/my-mentoring-journey</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since January, I&rsquo;ve worked at the <a href="http://www.theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a>, which has been a really great experience. As well as being a non-profit with a mission to make the world better, which is already a huge win as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the organisation also puts a massive emphasis on culture and people. For a small enterprise (less than 20 people), this is amazing, and I&rsquo;ve never seen anything quite like it anywhere I&rsquo;ve worked.</p>

<p>One major part of the culture is the approach to mentoring. Not content with just professional training, the ODI wants all employees to have access to a mentor outside the company, to help develop people in ways that <em>they</em> need, not necessarily in ways that obviously benefit the organisation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that I drifted through my professional life in a kind of random walk, without much of a plan. Admittedly, working at the ODI brings together so much of what I&rsquo;ve done over the years that it might <em>look</em> intentional, but it&rsquo;s really just another convenient accident. However, at 37, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to start trying to steer a little. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to get an answer to the classic interview question &ldquo;where do you see yourself in five years&#8217; time?&rdquo;. Because the ODI is about building a movement, a community, it&rsquo;s OK if the answer to the question is &ldquo;not here&rdquo;. People leaving the ODI and starting their own businesses is a Good Thing in a way it wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere else.</p>

<p>So, where do I want to be? Well, barring career discontinuities, I reckon I should be CTOing somewhere that&rsquo;s making a difference to the things I care about, somewhere in the openness, transparency, democracy, environmental impact sort of area, rather than day-to-day hacking. Maybe that&rsquo;s still the ODI, but if so I should look to be doing more of the strategic stuff by then.</p>

<p>Problem is, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s missing in order for me to get there. Technically, I can do anything I can turn my hand to, but I know there are deeper mysteries that I know nothing about, but that are important in the wider context of a CTO type role.</p>

<p>The mentoring program is a perfect framework to start thinking about this. I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough find a mentor who has gone through the transition from pure hacker to something a bit more strategic in the shape of <a href="http://flourish.org">Francis Irving</a>, ex of <a href="http://mysociety.org">MySociety</a> and now CEO of <a href="http://scraperwiki.com">ScraperWiki</a>. We share many of our ideals, and I hope I can learn a lot from someone who is a little further down the path than me.</p>

<p>Neither of us really know how this process will work, but we&rsquo;re starting with a bit of set reading (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator's_Dilemma">The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma</a> by Clayton M. Christensen) and seeing how it evolves. As we go along, I&rsquo;m going to try to share my thoughts and learning in public, partly as a way of marshalling my own thoughts, and partly as a way to pay Francis&#8217; generosity forward to others.</p>

<p>It will be an adventure, and hopefully I will come out of it with a better understanding both of myself, and my role in the better future I hope to build.</p>

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2012/08/01/activerecord-style-array-filtering-in-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2012/08/01/activerecord-style-array-filtering-in-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails&#8217; named scopes are fantastic for making readable code with efficient SQL behind the scenes. Given a Person model, you could define a scope called &#8216;adult&#8217; which could add an SQL <em>WHERE</em> for <em>age&gt;18</em>, and let you write pretty code like Person.adult to find all adults. Great! Chaining them together gets even better with code like Person.adult.male.with_glasses.</p>
<p>The problem comes if you do this in a single action with lots of different chained scopes to show different data. You end up with a whole bunch of SQL queries, which can get expensive. In the system I&#8217;m currently building, which includes geospatial queries, this gets far too slow to use. So, instead, let&#8217;s get one big list of objects and filter them in Ruby when we need them.</p>
<p>Simple enough. The only thing is, the ActiveRecord chaining syntax is lovely. I don&#8217;t want to write tons of chained selects with blocks and all that faff. Instead, let&#8217;s extend Array to give us the syntax we like. The trick is to wrap an Array inside another class and then use method_missing to delegate. We then make sure that returned objects aren&#8217;t Arrays, but our new type instead.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best explained with the code:</p>

</p>
<p>
It’s been an interesting year. Until April I worked at AMEE as their Platform
Evangelist. I’d been there almost four years, through lots of interesting times.
I got to do cool things like build AskAMEE, hack carbon emissions into Minecraft
(and get on BoingBoing with it), and run the London Green Hackathon. It was sad
when my time there came to an end, but in startup life there is always a point at
which it makes sense to move on.
</p>
<p>
Since then, I’ve been trying to find ways to carry making software that at least
tries to deal with the impending climate crisis that’s heading our way. As I discussed
at the beginning of the year, we don’t have long. I’ve been carrying on building
the Cleanweb UK community that we tried to bootstrap at AMEE on a voluntary basis.
London seems to have the most interesting cleanweb community in the world - we’ve
certainly been doing it longer than anyone else, so we have to capitalise on that
and work together!
</p>
<p>
However, the time has come for me to try and make a living out of this stuff again,
and I’m having a go at doing it by myself.
</p>
<p>
So, meet <a href="http://www.therm.uk.com">Therm</a>. It’s the first specialist cleanweb consultancy in the world (as
far as I know). If you’re doing anything on the web to do with sustainability, Therm
can help - get in touch!
</p>
<p>
It’s just me for now, but maybe later it won’t be. It’ll be an adventure, whatever
happens.

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2012/05/23/green-is-useless-to-me/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2012/05/23/green-is-useless-to-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Geek-Manifesto-ebook/dp/B007T99H6S" title="The Geek Manifesto">The Geek Manifesto</a>, by Mark Henderson, and, given my particular interests, I started near the end with the chapter on <em>Geeks and Greens</em> before starting properly at the beginning.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest reading it, but to summarise, the traditional green movement is generally unscientific and deeply political, and this has led to counterproductive politicisation and scepticism of scientific issues like climate change.</p>
<p>The greens latched onto a few things correctly by accident, like climate change research, but are still vastly wrong on many others. They come with too much junk science to be credible, and this leaks into the real science that they accidentally picked up. The association of the Green Party, for instance, with homeopathy and other alternative medicine approaches, is just sad in this day and age (although I believe it changed recently, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if the party still includes many who do believe this junk).</p>
<p>Add to that that many traditional greens have far-left politics which puts a lot of people off, and you end up with the conclusion that they *cannot* be trusted to be the main voice on important matters of science like climate change, which should essentially be an apolitical issue.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s NGOs like Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, or political parties like the Green Party here in the UK, they are just too embedded in their history to be able to deal with this properly. They can&#8217;t give up their hatred of nuclear power, for instance, or their opposition to GM science, both of which are probably going to be essential tools for our future, without alienating their core membership.</p>
<p>I agree with Mark that a new approach is needed, but I don&#8217;t think those organisations can be rescued &#8216;from the inside&#8217; as he suggests. They can carry on if they like, but even in the unlikely event that they change their views, the public&#8217;s perception of them would still be the same. We need something new, something reality-based, something that aims to have the clean high-tech future that I <em>personally</em> want.</p>
<p>Even the word &#8216;green&#8217; is now rendered useless by these viewpoints, so we have to just drop it and talk about &#8216;sustainability&#8217; and &#8216;clean&#8217; instead. If someone could come up with a catchy name for it that&#8217;s half as good as &#8216;green&#8217; though, that would be lovely.</p>

    <updated>2012-05-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2012/05/15/planet-hopper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, I went along to ISIC in Harwell to take part in the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a>, run by NASA. Hackdays are always fun, but this one was particularly exciting, because, you know, SPACE!</p>
<p>At first I thought about doing something with Earth observation data and climate change, but decided I&#8217;d give myself a break from that and do something else for once. After the usual shenanigans forming a team, a few of us started working on something to do with exoplanet data, particularly from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(spacecraft)" title="Kepler">Kepler satellite</a>.</p>
<p>We know about tons of planets now, but most people don&#8217;t know much about them. We decided to make something a bit fun and a bit educational. My sister is a physics teacher, so we aimed at creating something she could use in class to stimulate questions from the kids.</p>
<p>The result is <a href="http://www.planethopper.co.uk" title="Planet Hopper">Planet Hopper</a>, a webapp that allows you to explore the exoplanets and see various interesting facts about them in a friendly way. For instance, we tell you how old you would be on the planet, hoping to stimulate the question &#8216;why?&#8217;</p>
<p>We ended up winning the best hack prize at the Harwell site, and are currently in the global judging round, which is always nice.</p>
<p>Technically, this was my first experience with Django. In general, my first assessment was that it seemed perfectly capable, but not as slick as the Rails toolset perhaps. I&#8217;ll keep playing with it though, it&#8217;s always good to know more!</p>
<p>If you want to improve Planet Hopper, you can do; the code is, as always, <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/kepler-explorer" title="Code">on github</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: We won in the global judging! <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/blog/2012/05/18/global-winners-announced/">&#8220;Most Inspiring&#8221;</a> - pretty sweet! </p>

    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2012/03/12/the-need-for-cleanweb-rd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The newly-named cleanweb is a strange place. It&#8217;s all about social change, better sustainability, and other such noble goals, but it&#8217;s shackled by the demands of today&#8217;s economy; people with mortgages need proper jobs and investors need returns. The potential is enormous, but the opportunity to really explore it feels tiny. Some companies (like <a href="http://www.amee.com">AMEE</a>) do explore this space, but are still bound to go with the most commercially-viable opportunities. There&#8217;s very little space for blue-sky thinking.</p>
<p>I have a gut feeling that anything that truly changes behaviour will have to do so without the prospect of financial payback. By buying into the current assumptions about how the world should run, you&#8217;re maybe holding back the really ground-breaking ideas. There are some things that will work, sure, but thousands of ideas that could make the world better will never get off the ground because of a lack of business model.</p>
<p>What we need is a social-good model instead. We don&#8217;t need more space for entrepreneurs, but instead we need space for people who want to change the world for the better to do so. Not for money, but because it&#8217;s a good and noble and important thing to do. We need some way of supporting and developing great ideas that come out of events like the <a href="http://london.greenhackathon.com">London Green Hackathon</a>, even if they don&#8217;t have a way to make money for someone (though of course <a href="http://www.mastodonc.com">some do</a> and that&#8217;s great).</p>
<p>We need a Cleanweb R&amp;D Foundation of some kind, with a remit to simply make the world better and try things out. That would be a place that could really attack some truly innovative ideas. And it would be a hell of a lot of fun.</p>

    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2012/01/05/fixing-the-life-support</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Somehow, this year feels different.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because of the increase in public awareness of the problems with the world at the end of 2011. A greater understanding that governments and people don&#8217;t run the world any more, that we have given money too much power, that we are running full tilt at a cliff-edge; it feels like it&#8217;s adding up.</p>
<p>Charlie Brooker said recently that 2011&#160;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/11/charlie-brooker-2011-season-finale">felt like a series finale</a>; I&#8217;m not sure about that, it felt to me more like the buildup in the penultimate episode. 2012 seems like the actual last episode when the big events will happen (probably with a few cliff-hangers left over for 2013).</p>
<p>This impending feeling that big events are coming could be imaginary of course, but I hope not. We <em>need</em> big events now (and I don&#8217;t mean the obvious 2012 fake-apocalypse fantasy). We are racing so fast towards collapse that we have to do something <em>now</em>, or we will be a cautionary tale in the Cockroach Book Of Ancient Civilisations. We still have the ability to save ourselves (just); I hope that this year brings the will to engage with the problem.</p>
<p>We need to grow up, realise the full-spectrum danger we are in, and do something about it. We need to <em>mature</em> as a species, and fast. We need to get over our selfish approach and make a better society for the future, together.</p>
<p>I am a software engineer; that makes me next to useless in a collapsed society. My daughter quite literally <em>needs</em> a functioning, liberal, caring society to keep her alive. Moving to a farmhouse, becoming self-sufficient and letting everyone else collapse is no good for me. A functioning technological society is an essential life support system.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, I am going into this year with an objective to make best use of the skills I have to attack the big problems where I can, and if it doesn&#8217;t work out, to fail magnificently having <em>done my best</em>. </p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join me. We&#8217;ve got a hell of a job to do.</p>

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2011/07/01/hohm-and-powermeter/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2011/07/01/hohm-and-powermeter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last week has been an interesting one for online energy  monitoring. Not content with deprecating Powermeter a few weeks ago,  Google decided to <a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/google-pulls-the-plug-on-powermeter-energy-tool">properly kill it off.</a> And then, as if to say &#8216;us too!&#8217; (as they did with the initial launch), Microsoft <a href="http://blog.microsoft-hohm.com/news/11-06-30/Microsoft_Hohm_Service_Discontinuation.aspx">killed Hohm</a>.</p>
<p>Both these efforts were unsuccessful because the companies that put  them out weren&#8217;t serious about them. There is a place for  experimentation, but if you&#8217;re a massive company, even your small  experiments seem larger than other people&#8217;s entire companies. By  half-heartedly grabbing the attention around energy monitoring, these  experiments crowded out the people who are building a business around  this, like <a href="http://www.currentcost.com">Currentcost</a>, <a href="http://www.enio.co.uk">Enio</a>, <a href="http://pachube.com">Pachube</a> and many more.</p>
<p>The fact is that online energy monitoring is not dead - the demise of  these services will simply provide more room for other companies to  innovate without being stepped on. Neither Powermeter or Hohm were doing  anything particularly innovative that hadn&#8217;t been done many times  before anyway! Powermeter also suffered from being a silo of data, not a  hub. You could put data in, but not get it out, which is a bit  pointless. A truly useful service in this space needs to act as an  aggregator, letting data flow through it so that other innovations can  cluster around it, like the <a href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2011/04/20/">Social Meter</a> project, for instance.</p>
<p>Innovation needs openness, and by smothering a potentially innovative  space with their distinctly non-innovative services, MS and Google did  nobody any favours. We are better off without them.</p>

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2011/06/08/resolving-a-method_missing-fight/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2011/06/08/resolving-a-method_missing-fight</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I was writing tests for a piece of code, and came up against some strange problems. The code talks to an external web service using RestClient (1.6.1), so of course the web service is mocked for the tests, in this case using Mocha (0.9.8).</p>
<p class="western">The problem came when I tried to test failure modes; for instance, what happens when the service comes back with a 401 due to bad credentials? RestClient raises an exception for this containing the response, so the mock has to do the same.</p>

<pre>request.stubs(:put).raises(RestClient::Unauthorized.new(<br/>  stub(:code =&gt; 401, :body =&gt; nil)<br/>)</pre>
<p class="western">So far so good. The exception is raised, and all is well. The problem comes when we try to access the response code later on in our error-handling code:</p>

<pre>rescue RestClient::Exception =&gt; e
  puts e.response.code
</pre>
<p class="western">Seems reasonable, right? The response object should be a Mocha::Mock that responds to #code and gives back 401. Unfortunately not. We get a &#8216;stack too deep&#8217; error thrown inside a recursive method_missing call. Huh?</p>
<p class="western">This really should work, so let&#8217;s take a look inside the gems. It turns out that RestClient mixes something special into the response object (in this case the mock) for compatibility. The gem used to return Net::HTTP::Response objects, not RestClient::Response objects, so in order to retain compatibility with old code, it mixes in the behaviour of the Net::HTTP class to responses contained inside exceptions. This is taken from restclient/exceptions.rb:</p>

<pre># Compatibility : make the Response act like a <br/># Net::HTTPResponse when needed
module ResponseForException
  def method_missing symbol, *args
    if net_http_res.respond_to?(symbol)
      warn "[warning] ..."
      net_http_res.send symbol, *args
    else
      super
    end
  end
end

class Exception &lt; RuntimeError
  attr_accessor :message, :response

  def initialize response = nil, initial_response_code = nil
    @response = response
    @initial_response_code = initial_response_code
    # compatibility: this make the exception behave like <br/>    # a Net::HTTPResponse
    response.extend ResponseForException if response
  end
end
</pre>
<p class="western">As you can see, it does this by adding its own method_missing, which accesses the <strong>net_http_res</strong> function of the response. In our mock, that doesn&#8217;t exist, so of course method_missing is called ad infinitum. So, let&#8217;s add it:</p>

<pre>request.stubs(:put).raises(RestClient::Unauthorized.new(<br/>  stub(:code =&gt; 401, :body =&gt; nil, :net_http_res =&gt; nil)<br/>)</pre>
<p class="western">Better. Does it work now? Hm. No. It&#8217;s still digging a method_missing hole to the Earth&#8217;s core.</p>
<p class="western">The <strong>real</strong> problem is that the method_missing that is mixed in by RestClient::Exception is masking the one in Mocha::Mock, and that one is what does the actual handling of the stub code that we pass in. So, even though we added net_http_res up there, the bit of code that handles it is never called, so we&#8217;re still stuffed.</p>
<p class="western">Now, there&#8217;s not a lot we can do about that without rewriting the gems. If I <strong>was</strong> going to do that, I&#8217;d try to make sure that RestClient::Exception doesn&#8217;t mask existing method_missing functions, but instead aliases them and makes sure they are still called. Not sure how easy that would be, I&#8217;ve not tried it, but it would be worth a shot.</p>
<p class="western">I would try to make some general rule here about making sure your code plays nice with other code, but to be honest, I doubt you can consider every case where someone might be subverting your code by giving it things like mock objects (which could implement the mocking in any number of ways) instead of real ones. I guess there will always be a gap somewhere.</p>
<p class="western">The solution I hit upon in the end was to change the stub. Instead of using Mocha, which relies on method_missing to implement its stubbing, I changed to OpenStruct, which doesn&#8217;t, and is sufficient in this case.</p>

<pre>request.stubs(:put).raises(RestClient::Unauthorized.new(<br/>  OpenStruct.new(:code =&gt; 401, :body =&gt; nil, :net_http_res =&gt; nil)<br/>)</pre>
<p class="western">Yay, by using a stub that doesn&#8217;t require method_missing to operate, it all works nicely now! My tests are saved and I can get on with some real work&#8230; about time.</p>

    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2010/11/26/francis-maude-on-the-lrra</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
In 2006, I wrote to my MP about the Legislative and Regulator Reform Bill (now Act). The bill contained extremely dangerous powers for Ministers to change anything they liked, giving them the ability to get away with pretty much anything without a proper vote. I campaigned against it, with many others, through <a href="http://saveparliament.org.uk">Save Parliament</a>.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, my MP happens to be Francis Maude, who is now Minister for the Cabinet Office. It turns out that his government is now advancing a bill with similar powers, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/nov/09/lords-quangos">Public Bodies Bill</a>. Now, I admit I&#8217;ve not had chance to follow this in detail, so I <b>don&#8217;t</b> know if it&#8217;s as bad, or if it&#8217;s more limited. However, others who know more might be interested to know what Francis Maude had to say about those sort of powers four years ago.
</p>

<blockquote>
&#8220;I am particularly concerned at the potential for Parliament to be bypassed by the order-making powers contained in Part 1 of the Billl. These powers are extremely constitutionally significant.&#8221;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&#8220;It is imperative that the circumstances in which these powers can be used are limited and clearly set out in the Bill.&#8221;

Maybe the PBB is consistent with what he said 4 years ago, but maybe not. I&#8217;d be interested to know.

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2010/10/25/rewired-state-a-social-energy-monitor/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2010/10/25/rewired-state-a-social-energy-monitor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
The <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/events/carbon-and-energy">Rewired State Carbon &amp; Energy hack weekend</a> is coming up this weekend, and I&#8217;ve got a proposal for a hack I&#8217;d like to build (by kind permission of AMEE, my employer). I&#8217;m after a team to help, so if you&#8217;re interested, please get in touch.
</p>

<p>
Energy monitors are useful, but lack a certain something to keep people coming back to them. The web excels at social and game mechanics, but is &#8216;out there&#8217;, not present in the normal home environment. The idea is to bring the two together by building a system that takes realtime energy data from a home and displays similarly realtime social context for that data.
</p>

<p>
The end product is a simple display that shows not only current energy usage, but how that usage compares to other users of the system, <em>in real time</em>.
</p>

<p>
How it works: each home (probably just one in the initial hack, with the rest mocked up) has a CurrentCost meter. This, via a script or bridge device, submits 5-minute energy usage readings into AMEE, where it&#8217;s stored and its carbon equivalent calculated. A website is then created to take that information from all registered devices and do some simple stats. It will calculate a realtime league table, position for each user, realtime average power usage, and so on. This, along with the user&#8217;s own data, is then displayed on a screen in the home - I have an O2 Joggler touchscreen which would do the trick, either through a browser or via a native OpenPeak app.
</p>

<p>
The panel continuously shows the home user their energy usage, but also what their usage is compared to other users <em>right now</em>. It might display chart position, whether usage is going up or down, and other simple stats perhaps aggregated over time. This will bring some essential social context into the home energy monitoring space, and demonstrate the sort of innovation that can take place if smart metering systems are kept open.
</p>

<p>
Many parts of the system exist already, so I think this is buildable in a weekend at least as a prototype. Like I say, if you want to help me build it, get in touch in the comments or via Twitter (#rscarbon).

    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2010/05/06/what-did-you-do-in-the-election-daddy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
One wondeful thing about the 2010 General Election is that so many great projects have happened online; Francis Irving covers them in a <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2010/05/05/election-data/">post on the OKFN blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
I was personally lucky enough to find the time to use these services to build something. I couldn&#8217;t find election hustings in my area, so I decided to make a site to crowdsource and open up that information properly. Enter <a href="http://questionyourcandidates.org.uk">QuestionYourCandidates</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/twitpic/photos/large/89425316.png?AWSAccessKeyId=0ZRYP5X5F6FSMBCCSE82&amp;Expires=1273159187&amp;Signature=ERA7Bsv2Xe57mOGIPoCZ7QCUQjo%3D"/></p>

<p>
The site allows anyone to enter details of hustings in their area, basically, and link to them in a reliable way. It&#8217;s made from:
</p>

<ul><li>Rails 2.3.5 - this reminded me how excellent Rails is for rapid development</li>
<li>Constituency &amp; candidate data from <a href="http://yournextmp.com">YourNextMP</a> through their API.</li>
<li>Postcode search via the <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou</a> API.
</li></ul><p>
Both these APIs were incredibly easy to use, and because they use canonical names for both constituencies and candidates, it was easy to then link the site across to other services like <a href="http://democracyclub.org.uk">Democracy Club</a> and <a href="http://thestraightchoice.org">The Straight Choice</a>.
</p>

<p>
The main dilemma while coding I had was whether to have user accounts. I decided against it in the end, just protecting the edit pages with a captcha. User accounts would have just added another layer of complexity, for really no extra functionality or security.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing took around 6 hours from start to deploy, and I&#8217;m pretty proud of it. Unfortunately I did it a bit late to really be useful for this election, but I will try to generalise it to is can continue to be used for future elections. And, as always, it&#8217;s open source. Code is on <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/questionyourcandidates">Github</a>.

    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2009/12/17/my-ecomo09-google-maps-hack</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/6907428" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe><br/><p>In early September, <a href="http://www.betavine.net/bvportal/community/sustainability">Betavine</a> organised a 24-hour hack event called <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/6623187">EcoMo09</a>, with an environmental theme. Unfortunately I couldn’t stay the whole time, but I went along as an <a href="http://www.amee.com">AMEE</a> representative to support other people using our API during the event.  In the quiet periods, I managed to come up with my own hack, which used  GreaseMonkey and AMEE to add carbon emissions to Google Maps.</p>
<p>You can even <a href="http://gist.github.com/185744">get the code</a> and try it yourself. It’s very basic, and actually most of the work was  dealing with Google Maps and making Greasemonkey behave properly - the  AMEE bit, getting the carbon value, was dead easy.</p>

    <updated>2009-11-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2009/11/10/the-activist-geek-philosophy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
So, first, let&#8217;s have a stab at identifying the community I&#8217;m talking about - this in itself is a pretty hard problem. I guess I&#8217;m talking about &#8220;activist geeks&#8221;, in a way. The sort of people who are involved in the work of <a href="http://mysociety.org">MySociety</a>, or <a href="http://www.sicamp.org/">Social Innovation Camp</a>. The people who go along to events like <a href="http://www.geekyoto.com/">geeKyoto</a>, or perhaps <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2009/08/interesting-speakers.html">Interesting</a>. They are the people that go out and create innovative things that make the world better. I can&#8217;t put any names on a list here, though there are some obvious ones of course, but you will probably know if this is your sort of community or not.
</p>

<p>
So having made a (very) vague stab at who I&#8217;m talking about, what are the core philosophies that come out of that? One caveat: obviously this is  my own personal viewpoint, and implies absolutely nothing on behalf of those examples linked above. I could be completely wrong on all of this (though I&#8217;d invite comment). I think I am what would traditionally be called &#8220;left wing&#8221;, so my please note that my views may be coloured by that.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I think that while there are certain things that do unite the community, they often don&#8217;t fit along traditional political lines. You cannot say that this community is left-wing for instance; there are certainly members of all political parties involved. We&#8217;ll come back to some of the things that <em>don&#8217;t</em> unite us later on, but let&#8217;s find some common ground first.
</p>

<dl><dt><b>Privacy</b></dt>
<dd>
Even though many of us share vast amounts of information on various social networks, we have a strong belief in privacy of personal data. Perhaps this is better phrased as belief in <em>control</em> of personal data. I can delete my social network accounts at any time, and can decide who can see them, so I remain in control (as long as I trust the site). On the other side, I will not be able to remove my record from the ID card database or decide who accesses it, so I am not in control of that. This is part of a more fundamental belief in <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">universal human rights.</a>
</dd>
<dt><b>Transparency</b></dt>
<dd>
While personal information should be kept tightly controlled by its owner, information about (and generated by) government and public services should be fully transparent and open. The MP expenses scandal was an example of further erosion of trust in government because of an opaque system that was open to abuse. As they say (I think), sunlight is the best disinfectant. Government operations should be open to public scrutiny, and assets produced by that system (OS maps anyone?) should be freely available to the taxpayers who have paid for them.
</dd>
<dt><b>Tolerance</b></dt>
<dd>
I don&#8217;t think we give a monkeys where someone is from, what their background is, or about their religion, sexuality, or favourite colour. It&#8217;s just not relevant. The rest of you, get over it.
</dd>
<dt><b>Anti-authoritarian</b></dt>
<dd>
It always confuses me that a criticism of the left is that it wants to control people. Maybe that&#8217;s true, in which case I need to recalibrate my open personal compass a little, but my belief is that the community is very much about freedom of the individual. There is a strong anti-authoritarian streak - none of us want to end up in a police state.

<dt><b>Social Conscience</b></dt>

However, the above freedom of the individual does not lead to blind self-interest. I believe that the community is not one of self-interested people with no care for others, but of a group of empowered individuals who actively engage in and make society better.
</dd>
<dt><b>Engagement</b></dt>
<dd>
My final point is that the above lead to a community that is engaged with the world around them. We engage on issues of importance, such as my own personal focus, climate change, and they are interested in the way their society is governed. I believe that those qualities are fundamental for a functioning democracy, and we see that currently most of society does not measure up to that standard (a situation which we try to improve of course).
</dd>

On the other hand, I seriously doubt we are all united on things like <a href="http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-AO890_invisi_20070824192939.jpg">economics</a> (I love that picture), the role of corporations, how to deal with climate change, foreign policy, and so on.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m sure there is more that can be said, but I will let it play out in the comments (if anyone wants to add to this). My final question is - if there is a central theme emerging, does that mean we should do something with it in these days when so many of the above viewpoints are rather missing from general society?

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[IBM DeveloperWorks articles]]></title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Over the summer, I was asked to write an article for the IBM <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/">DeveloperWorks</a> site about energy monitoring and so on. Eventually, that turned into a series of articles centered around <a href="http://www.amee.com">AMEE</a> and how you can track energy consumption and calculate carbon emissions with it.
</p>

<p>
So, now that they&#8217;re all published, here&#8217;s a bit of a linkdump to the various articles and other things that came out of them.
</p>

<dl><dt>
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-ameeintro/">Introduction to AMEE</a>
</dt>
<dd>
This is a technical introduction to the AMEE platform, how it works, and what you can do with it. It covers things like signing up, creating profiles, storing data, and getting results. It was also adapted into a screencast for the <a href="http://my.amee.com/developers">AMEE developer site</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-green-ict/index.html?S_TACT=105AGX44&amp;S_CMP=HP">Calculate your computer&#8217;s carbon footprint using AMEE</a>
</dt>
<dd>
This one is an introduction to the wide variety of ways in which you can track energy data using AMEE, using the monitoring of computer energy use as a case study. It also shows some code examples for the <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/amee-ruby">AMEE ruby gem</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/tutorials/x-ameetut/index.html">Monitor home energy with AMEE</a>
</dt>
<dd>
This is my favourite of the three - a long tutorial, with lots of code, which shows a complete implementation of an online energy-monitoring system, using a <a href="http://www.currentcost.com">CurrentCost</a> display, AMEE, and a little Rails code. This uses a lot of the open source software I&#8217;ve been writing over the last year, which regular readers will have seen in previous posts, but it&#8217;s really nice to tie it all together and tell the world how it works!
</dd>
<dt>
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/scott/entry/james_smith_on_embedding_environmental_intelligence">James Smith on embedding environmental intelligence</a>
</dt>
<dd>
Scott Laningham was nice enough to interview me for the DeveloperWorks podcast when the first article went out, so if you want to hear me blathering on about it in person, you can do so!

I was lucky enough to be invited to talk at the <a href="http://www.rebootbritain.com">Reboot Britain</a> conference on Monday. It was a fascinating day, with lots of inspiring moments. It left me with a feeling that we can make the world a better place if we all get out there and <b>make</b> things. It&#8217;s something I already believed, but it&#8217;s great to have a recharge every now and again.
</p>

<p>
My session was on hacking energy data, kind of a <a href="http://homecamp.org.uk">Homecamp</a> intro for the uninitiated. My slides are up on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Furtive">Slideshare</a>, and embedded here for your viewing pleasure. Hopefully at some point I&#8217;ll get to re-record the audio and add it in.
