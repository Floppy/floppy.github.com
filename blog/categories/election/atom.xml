    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things we want to do with Something New is to be as transparent as we possible can on donations and spending. We do have to report a certain amount to the Electoral Commission, but it&rsquo;s also about walking the talk of openness and transparency.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not raising money yet, so donations will come later, but we have started to track our spending. Working at the ODI, I&rsquo;m surrounded by smart people, and there&rsquo;s always someone who knows about whatever you&rsquo;re trying to do. So, when thinking about spending data, I went to have a chat with Ian Makgill of <a href="https://spendnetwork.com/">Spend Network</a>, and asked if there were any formats that parties already use.</p>

<p>Fairly obviously, there weren&rsquo;t, so I then asked &ldquo;what would you <em>want</em> them to do?&rdquo;, and together we came up with a decent schema for political spending data. We&rsquo;re now publishing our finances in that format, so I thought I&rsquo;d give you a quick run through.</p>

<p>I talked about this in a recent <a href="theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-for-democracy-how-to-stand-for-parliament-with-open-data">ODI Friday Lunchtime Lecture</a>, so you can watch the video if you like. Or, read on below&hellip;</p>

<div style="width:500px; height:281px; margin: 0px auto">
  <iframe src="http://floppy.org.uk//player.vimeo.com/video/111864914" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="281px" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<h2>Schema</h2>

<p>You can see the full schema on our <a href="https://somethingnewuk.github.io/finances/">finances microsite</a>.</p>

<p>It divides into a few sections. First there are names for suppliers and buyers, but also URIs, so we can uniquely identify them and correlate across other spending. Then we have the amount and date, including foreign currency where appropriate. Next comes a description of the item, and some categorisation of the product or service, and finally the supplier&rsquo;s transaction ID. I want to add links to (PDF?) copies of receipts as well, though I&rsquo;ve not got to that yet.</p>

<p>There are a few interesting parts to this, which I&rsquo;ll go into next&hellip;</p>

<h2>URIs</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy enough to write the name of a company or buyer, but if we want to uniquely identify them, we need a URI. For companies, we use the <a href="http://opencorporates.com">OpenCorporates</a> URL; they cover millions of companies across the world, which is great. Unfortunately they don’t seem to include <a href="http://nationbuilder.com">NationBuilder</a>, who I suspect are based somewhere OpenCorporates don’t cover yet. Won’t be long, I’m sure.</p>

<p>Charities are another matter; there isn&rsquo;t a stable-looking URL for a charity on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission">Charity Commission</a> website, only a search box. Fortunately there is a project called <a href="http://opencharities.org/">OpenCharities</a> which does the same thing for charities as OpenCorporates does for companies, so I can use their URLs. Hurrah for Open Data.</p>

<p>One room I booked was from&hellip; I have no idea. I guess it&rsquo;s an unincorporated association. How we define URIs for things that barely exist legally, I don&rsquo;t know. If you do, let me know.</p>

<p>The last bit here is URIs for councils. Again, when booking rooms, councils are often the supplier, particularly Parish Councils. The LGA defines a set of URIs for councils down to the local authority level, but it doesn&rsquo;t go down to the parish level. In fact, it looks like there may not even be a proper list of parish councils, let alone a URI for each. The closest we have appears to be <a href="http://politicsresources.net/area/uk/parish.htm">this unofficial list</a>. We could do with an OpenCouncils project, perhaps, to bring these all together and let people reference them reliably.</p>

<p>The last bit on URIs was to talk about buyer URIs. For the party, that should be easy enough, but for individuals? What&rsquo;s <em>my</em> URI? I don&rsquo;t feel quite right with it just being my website, but that&rsquo;s basically the right thing to do. So, I&rsquo;ve made one up. If you need to refer to me officially, you can use <a href="http://id.floppy.org.uk">http://id.floppy.org.uk</a>. It also acts as an OpenID delegator (see the source for how), so it&rsquo;s now also my OpenID. If you visit it, you won&rsquo;t get much though, except a GIF of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBpF_Zj4OA">rotating owl</a>. Because&hellip; reasons.</p>

<h2>Codes</h2>

<p>Moving on, let&rsquo;s talk about codes. We use two different coding schemes for the data. The first is from the electoral commission, which is only really useful for official reporting. The other is the <a href="http://unspsc.org">UN Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC)</a>. The UNSPSC has a decent search function, so it&rsquo;s easy enough to classify your spending, and the categories are <em>very</em> fine-grained. At least, they are in the area of traditional products; it&rsquo;s a bit vague on the whole &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; thing. Probably needs an update. Still, it&rsquo;s a standard, and will suffice for us. We can always use new codes as they create them.</p>

<h2>Publishing</h2>

<p>The last bit to talk about is how we publish the data. As I mentioned, the schema and data are wrapped up in a Datapackage, which is a JSON file which lists the fields, license, data file locations, etc. All this is in a <a href="https://github.com/SomethingNewUK/finances">GitHub repository</a>, and it&rsquo;s the live version, which means that we&rsquo;re not really publishing our data; instead you&rsquo;re seeing the real thing all the time.</p>

<p>Having the data in GitHub lets us do something cool &ndash; publish it on the web using github pages. If it&rsquo;s in a gh-pages branch, GitHub will publish it for us, and run it through <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which means you can also generate HTML pages alongside.</p>

<p>Jekyll has support for data files, both in JSON and YAML, and in CSV (which I <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/2761">specifically added</a> over the summer so I could use it for this &ndash; yay Open Source!). If we tell Jekyll that our entire repository is a source of data files, we can access all the files, both the CSVs and datapackage, from the HTML-generating files. That means we can have a single source of data, and use Jekyll to automatically publish both a human-readable version and the original machine-readable files. We&rsquo;ve basically rolled our own data publishing system, which is pretty cool. You can see how it all works in the <a href="https://github.com/SomethingNewUK/finances">repository</a>, but if you need more explanation, leave a comment and I&rsquo;ll elaborate.</p>

<h2>Validation &amp; Certification</h2>

<p>The last thing is that it&rsquo;s all validated and certified using tools I&rsquo;ve helped build at the ODI. We use <a href="http://csvlint.io">CSVlint</a> to check that the CSV files are valid when they&rsquo;re committed, and we&rsquo;ve also obtained an <a href="https://certificates.theodi.org/datasets/2254/certificates/14550">Open Data Certificate</a> for the data, showing that it&rsquo;s good, reliable, open data.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see more parties doing this. The data schema is totally reusable, as is the rest, and this took me no more than a few hours to put together from scratch. There is no technological reason why all the parties couldn&rsquo;t open up all their data tomorrow. All that they lack is the vision and the courage.</p>

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2014/10/13/github-democracy/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-13T06:45:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2014/10/13/github-democracy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year and a quarter ago, in a fit of political anger,
I proposed that a bunch of us should start collaborating
on the public policies we&rsquo;d <em>like</em> to see, rather than just complaining on Twitter.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m a software developer, I suggested that we could use GitHub as a platform,
and a few of us started doing exactly that. 15 months later, the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a>
contains nearly 8000 words of agreed policy ideas, has inspired me to <a href="http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/local/father-of-two-launches-bid-to-be-horsham-s-next-mp-1-6168976">stand for
election</a>, and has spawned a <a href="http://somethingnew.org.uk">political party</a> which has adopted the manifesto (though
it remains an independent project). I&rsquo;m quite proud of all of that.</p>

<p>Last night, someone new to the project asked me how it worked, and to clarify who
can take part, and I realised I&rsquo;ve never really written it up in a blog form. We have
the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk/contributing.html">contributing guide</a>, but that&rsquo;s probably fairly well buried. So, in this post I&rsquo;m
going to explain the democratic process we&rsquo;ve arrived at over the last 15 months.</p>

<h2>Who can make changes?</h2>

<p>The simple answer here is &ldquo;anyone&rdquo;, though the reality is slightly more complex.</p>

<p>Anyone with a GitHub account can hit the edit button and change the text to match what
they want. Thanks to GitHub&rsquo;s great workflow tools, this automatically creates a fork
of the project (a copy, basically) and submits a pull request (PR), which you can
think of as a &ldquo;request to adopt the proposed change&rdquo;. The user interface here can
be confusing to new users though, and that&rsquo;s something we want to improve.</p>

<p>Anyway, once your change is made, it gets added to the <a href="http://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/pulls">pull request queue</a>, ready
for inspection.</p>

<h2>Who decides what gets accepted?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re modeled on an open-source type workflow, not a straight-majority universal-suffrage
democratic model. That means that while anyone can submit a change, <em>not</em> everyone gets
to vote straight away.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re a little different from other open policymaking tools, in that we&rsquo;re not actually
trying to express a solution that satisfies the majority. We&rsquo;re trying, with help from
everybody, to build a cohesive platform that will hopefully appeal to some voters. This
is a party-style manifesto, not a universally-accepted list of things we should do.</p>

<p>So, because of that, you can only vote on a change if you&rsquo;ve already made a contribution.
That means that the project should be able to maintain the direction and general outlook
that it started with, without being twisted around.</p>

<p>However, as soon as your change is in, you get to vote, so nobody maintains a list of
&ldquo;approved&rdquo; contributors. If you add something good enough to get in, you get control.</p>

<p>This is really similar to the process in a bit of open source software, where existing maintainers decide what gets added in order to keep the project moving the right way.</p>

<p><img src="http://memecrunch.com/meme/L5EI/service-guarantees-citizenship/image.png" alt="Service Guarantees Citizenship" /></p>

<h2>What about takeovers?</h2>

<p>People often ask what we do about hostile takeovers. Say a number of people make helpful
and acceptable additions (thanks!), but then gang together and vote to bring back
capital punishment.</p>

<p>Again, the open source model helps us here. We can&rsquo;t stop that happening, not at all.
However, it would gain the attacker pretty much nothing, as anyone in the world is
entitled to take the project and fork it into a parallel effort at any time.</p>

<p>If something happened that a caused a large split in the group, I have no doubt the project
would fork into two. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing &ndash; the two forks can still share the ideas they
agree on, while maintaining their own differences.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how this will work in practice. I guess we&rsquo;ll cross that bridge when we come to it, but I think we have an escape route prepared if we need it.</p>

<h2>How do changes get voted on?</h2>

<p>I initially expected that we&rsquo;d go with a straight majority vote of contributors, but that&rsquo;s
not what we&rsquo;re doing right now. The long tail of participation is as true in this project
as in any online space, so we have a few very active contributors, some less-regular ones,
and a long tail of people who&rsquo;ve only contributed once.</p>

<p>Because of this, it would be easy for the regular contributors to overrule the long
tail, but that would lead to complete disengagement and a &ldquo;why should I contribute&rdquo;
reaction. After all, if the cabal control all the votes, there&rsquo;s no power.</p>

<p>So, we use a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackballing">blackballing</a> system instead. A change must get &ldquo;yes&rdquo; votes from 10%
of the contributors in order to be passed. However, anyone can block a change,
which means we can&rsquo;t merge it until that block is removed. That means that anyone in the
long tail can make their objections known over the view of the regular contributors, and
force improvements and further discussion.</p>

<p>So far, this has worked OK. We have a few changes that have been blocked for a long time,
and how to work through those blocks is something we&rsquo;re still learning, but in general it&rsquo;s
working OK.</p>

<p>We try to make sure that blocks are substantive; that is, a simple &ldquo;NO&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t allowed.
For a block to be considered, it must come with reasons, requests for more evidence, or some
other form of constructive feedback. Generally this does seem to happen.</p>

<p>We also keep each vote open for 14 days to give the long tail time to respond.</p>

<h2>Who counts the votes?</h2>

<p>Robots!</p>

<p>Votes are currently expressed in GitHub comments with +1 / -1 statements (using emoticons), and we have a <a href="http://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk">script that watches those changes</a> and counts them up. There are a number of rules enforced by the robot; for instance, yes votes are cleared by a change to the PR (so you can&rsquo;t amend at the last minute).</p>

<p>Using the GitHub API, we check all this stuff, and then we set the build status appropriately for the change. This means that the GitHub merge button will have a warning on it until the time period has expired, and until it has enough votes and no blocks.</p>

<p>Nothing fundamentally stops earlier merging, and that does happen sometimes for spelling corrections, etc. Only a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openpolitics/teams/owners">couple of admins</a> have merge powers, so there is a potential corruption point there; perhaps the robot should do the merging as well, but it&rsquo;s nice to have a human in the final check.</p>

<p>The robot also helps with making the information more accessible. It sends tweets from
<a href="http://twitter.com/openpoliticsuk">@OpenPoliticsUK</a> for new changes, and notifies our  <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net#openpolitics">#openpolitics IRC channel</a>. It also
has a few web pages that <a href="http://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk/227">list vote status</a> in a simple way, so we can see who&rsquo;s taking
part, who&rsquo;s voted which way. There is also a <a href="http://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk/users/Floppy">user page</a> for every contributor that shows
what they have and haven&rsquo;t voted on.</p>

<p>Of course, the robot is <a href="http://github.com/openpolitics/votebot">open source</a>, so you can check that the rules match what&rsquo;s agreed.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>Usability is a big concern. Currently we use the GitHub editor; I&rsquo;d rather use <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a>,
but it has a massive <a href="https://github.com/prose/prose/issues/643">bug</a> in it that means that new users don&rsquo;t get invited to sign in to
GitHub first, and changes get lost. If you can fix that, I&rsquo;ll pay you a <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1839687-unauthenticated-users-can-t-submit-pull-requests">$25 bounty</a>.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m starting to think we need a completely custom editor that explains every step
along the way, and hides the GitHubness right down away from the user. Ideally the
contributor shouldn&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re using GitHub (unless they want to). The version control
base layer is important for change visibility, accountability, forking, and so on, but
expecting non-developers to be OK with it from the outset is asking a bit much.</p>

<p>There are other options for the voting as well; I&rsquo;d like to get something like <a href="http://loomio.org/">Loomio</a> or
<a href="http://democracyos.org/">DemocracyOS</a> integrated into the voting system, so that people don&rsquo;t need to use the pull
request UI to discuss and vote. Again, maybe this should be a custom thing that presents
the information exactly the way we want.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to experiment with wider (but less official) feedback using something like <a href="http://iagr.ee">IAgree</a>. It would be great to have a user agreement level on every point in the manifesto.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re working on any of those tools, I&rsquo;m more than happy to offer input into your API design process!</p>

<h2>Will this scale?</h2>

<p>The simple answer here is &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. I really don&rsquo;t. This is an evolved process
that works for us right now. It will certainly change in future to cope with changing
demand, and I can&rsquo;t anticipate exactly how that will happen.</p>

<p>For now, we&rsquo;re building political policy in a way that anyone can get involved with, and
for me that&rsquo;s revolutionary. How that revolution copes when it hits the mainstream is
a scary adventure I&rsquo;m looking forward to, but as often stated in software, scaling problems
are &ldquo;good problems to have&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you want to get involved, visit the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a> and make a change. If you
want to vote for someone who is using it, or want to stand on the principles yourself,
I humbly suggest you check out our party, <a href="http://somethingnew.org.uk">Something New</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2014/10/08/face-to-face/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-08T19:59:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://floppy.org.uk/blog/2014/10/08/face-to-face</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the
<a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I held the <a href="/blog/2014/08/05/horsham-election-meetup-1/">first public meeting</a> for my election campaign.
It was a small affair, but it was clear that this was something that I&rsquo;m
going to have to do a lot more of. Whether it&rsquo;s creating an appointment
time for people to come and ask questions and put across concerns
individually, or a group discussion, it&rsquo;s good to get into a rhythm and
be available to people.</p>

<p>I decided I wanted to basically run a public meeting a week from the beginning of
October until the election. The idea is to provide a space for discussion, ideas,
questions, and for people to raise issues.</p>

<p>They will be poorly-attended at first, but the
message will spread, and starting is important. Question is, where to have
them? Well, as with everything else so far, let&rsquo;s look at the data!</p>

<h2>Wards</h2>

<p>Horsham constituency is divided into 18 wards. Just under half of them are
in Horsham itself, and the rest cover the surrounding countryside and
smaller towns. In order to be available to people, it would be good to run
at least one event in each ward, so that people don&rsquo;t have to travel too
far, and see their candidate in their local community.</p>

<p>However, wards vary widely in population, so it&rsquo;s not just a matter of
going to each one once. I should really go to the larger ones more, to try
and cover the population more evenly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/horsham_wards.png" alt="Wards" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/electionmaps">Ordnance Survey election map</a> shows wards as well as constituencies,
so it&rsquo;s easy enough to find which wards we need to cover. Each area has an
&ldquo;statistical identifier&rdquo;, which is a unique code for that area. Helpfully,
the ONS also break down their <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/data/area-first/">census statistics</a> using the same identifier,
so with a little bit of work, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get the adult population of each
ward (16+ actually, but it was in 2011, so that&rsquo;s near enough).</p>

<p>If we order the wards by population, and work out the number of weeks we
have available, we can work out which wards we have time to visit twice.
I&rsquo;ve left a gap around Christmas, and for a couple of other weeks
where I already know I&rsquo;m prebooked on the Tuesday (which is the day I&rsquo;m
aiming for).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as simple as just visiting in size order though; I&rsquo;ve manipulated
the list and swapped a few things around so that I jump around the constituency.
Ideally, every other week should be in Horsham, and the other weeks I&rsquo;ll
alternate east/west or north/south across the other wards. That should get
me near everyone on a fairly regular basis, and avoid spending too much
time concentrating on one area.</p>

<p>I did consider writing a bit of code to work this out, but as it was only
28 weeks and 18 locations, it wasn&rsquo;t worth it. Also, it might be a
variation of a very hard computer science problem, so no time for that.</p>

<p>As the dates turn out, I&rsquo;ll hit every ward in size order after the new year,
and I&rsquo;m starting with events in the largest 10 between now and Christmas. Another
nice thing is that the largest ward is Horsham Park, right in the middle of town,
so in the week of the election hopefully we can get a nice big finish!</p>

<h2>Venues</h2>

<p>So, where to actually meet people? I had heard that some public buildings
are available for political candidates to use for free, so I called the
local council&rsquo;s election officer to have a chat. As with my other
conversations with election folk at various organisations, they were very
helpful.</p>

<p>The rule seems to be that candidates can use a publicly-maintained building
free of charge; however, many things like village halls, etc, are not in fact
publicly maintained buildings. In fact the only places they could suggest that
were widely spread across the area were schools, who apparently would be OK
with being used in that way. There shouldn&rsquo;t be a hire charge, but they might
have to charge for caretaking; having someone to lock up, etc.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that simple either; there are more rooms available free of charge, but only
once the election has actually been called, which basically means during April.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m just going to have to call a whole load of places and see
what I can negotiate on a case-by-case basis. It will end up adding a fair amount
to the budget too &ndash; if it costs me £30 a week for a room, times 28 weeks&hellip; erk.</p>

<p>But, it&rsquo;s important, so it&rsquo;s time to put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s Go!</h2>

<p>So, armed with that information and a plan, I&rsquo;ve started booking things, and I actually ran
the first event in the series last night in Roffey North. Keep an eye on the <a href="http://horsham.somethingnew.org.uk/calendar">calendar</a> for future events, and I&rsquo;ll add them as I get the venues booked in, and if you&rsquo;re in Horsham, hopefully I&rsquo;ll see you soon at an event near you!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the train on the way home from <a href="http://emfcamp.org">Electromagnetic Field 2014</a>. It&rsquo;s a sort of technology / maker festival in a field near Milton Keynes. Imagine a load of tech geeks camping in tents with laser cutters, LEDs, laptops, excellent wifi, and a robot that makes cocktails. It&rsquo;s an amazing place.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to get a speaking slot to talk about my current project, standing for Parliament next year. As it happened, there were two other talks on a similar theme; <a href="https://twitter.com/tom_watson">Tom Watson MP</a> spoke about <a href="/blog/2014/07/14/drip-an-open-letter-to-francis-maude/">DRIP</a>, and <a href="http://www.danjellinek.com/">Dan Jellinek</a> talked about digital democracy ideas and tools, so there was a common thread between all our talks.</p>

<p>All three of us wanted more people to get engaged in politics. Tom Watson went as far as challenging people to join their local Labour or Conservative parties and change them from the inside (which, given enough people, could totally work, though I would like to try a different path).</p>

<p>My talk went down really well, I think. I was very pleased with the turnout, and there were loads of great questions at the end. I came away more convinced that what I&rsquo;m trying to do will resonate with a whole load of people. The new party name that I presented also went down really well, though I&rsquo;ll tell <em>you</em> all about it in a future post &ndash; stay tuned.</p>

<p>To give people a chance to discuss things further, we held an informal democracy meetup on Saturday evening. I expected a few people to turn up, but we had over 40 and packed out our tent, with standing room only. What followed was two hours of lively debate, discussion, and passion from the people who came along, and I was absolutely blown away by how much people <em>do</em> care, and <em>do</em> want to get involved.</p>

<p>The icing on the cake was Sunday morning. I was walking to get some breakfast and I ran into one of the participants from the night before. He told me that I&rsquo;d inspired him to stand as well, which is just <em>amazing</em>. I&rsquo;ve since had a few others email or grab me around the event saying they want to get more involved and help out somehow. I&rsquo;m &hellip; honoured.</p>

<p>After this weekend, I&rsquo;m even more convinced that this is the start of a movement, the start of something big. The start of something new.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>This morning, I learnt a bit about leafletting. As a candidate, the bare minimum for a campaign has to be getting a leaflet through every door, so that people are informed of their choices (although a good half the candidates at the 2010 election didn&rsquo;t manage that).</p>

<p>I figured this would be a major cost; I&rsquo;m amazed how wrong that turned out to be.</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>

<p>First things first &ndash; how much will it cost to get these things printed? Ideally I&rsquo;d like to have a 4-page A5 leaflet with full colour printing, and enough for every household in the constituency.</p>

<p>How many is that? Well, let&rsquo;s start with a rough estimate from the 2011 census. The <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/data/area-first/">ONS data explorer</a> makes this pretty easy. You can choose your reporting area by parliamentary constituency, and then find out all sorts of information about the area, including number of households. Turns out, in 2011, there were 43,380 households in the Horsham constituency.</p>

<p>So what will it cost us to print that many? Last night I emailed a request for quotes to four local printers, and was amazed to get back quotes in the £1000-1500 range. Considering that party spending on unsolicited mailings was around £4500 at the last election, this is a lot less than I expected. I wonder where the rest of their money went? Presumably more than one leaflet; perhaps targeted drops for likely voters.</p>

<h2>Delivery</h2>

<p>This is where it gets awesome. As a parliamentary candidate, you get one free mailing from the Royal Mail. That&rsquo;s right, <em>free</em>.</p>

<p>You can choose addressed mailings to every voter, or an unaddressed mailing to each household (i.e. a normal leaflet drop). The Royal Mail have <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/specialist-services/candidate-mailing">a special candidate mailing area on their website</a> all about this, and so I had a read and phoned up their election people, who were <em>very</em> helpful.</p>

<p>The way it works is; a few weeks before the election, you send your artwork to them to check for compliance with the election and postal rules, and once it&rsquo;s approved, you get given a named Election Manager and instructions on where to drop off your leaflets. Simple as that. They also tell you exactly how many you need to print.</p>

<p>After that, you just get them printed, and drop them off at least 7-10 days before the election. They then deliver them over the next week. You can deliver earlier of course, that&rsquo;s just the latest possible date.</p>

<p>They were helpful enough to tell me how many leaflets were dropped in the recent EU elections, which was about 47,300. A bit higher than the census data, but not far off. I&rsquo;d better budget for about 50,000 next year, allowing for new development, etc, but that won&rsquo;t change the figures too much.</p>

<p>They have a <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/CandidateMail_EuropeanElection_Brochure_Mar2014a.pdf">guidance document for the EU elections</a> up on their site. For now, it&rsquo;s good enough to work from; the 2015 election guidance won&rsquo;t be up until next year.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So, all in all this looks pretty easy. If I can raise £1500-ish, and design a leaflet (which some of the printers can help with for a little more), I can get the Royal Mail to deliver it, and everyone in the area will get told about me.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t all the printing of course; more will be needed to be able to hand out flyers to people before the final leaflet drop, but it&rsquo;s a great baseline. I thought that would cost a lot more, and it&rsquo;s once again underlined just how accessible this actually is.</p>
