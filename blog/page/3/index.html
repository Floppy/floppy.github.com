      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the archive for other posts.</em></p>

<p>After talking to the electoral commission yesterday, I got interested in what local candidates normally spend on their campaigns.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is all open data. The Electoral Commission publish the statistics about election spending on their website, all under the Open Government License. All figures in this article come from them.</p>

<p>There is one particular dataset which we&rsquo;ll dive into here; the <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/uk-general-elections/candidate-election-spending">candidate spending in the 2010 general election</a>. This lists all candidates in the general election of 2010, what they spent, what they raised, and even better, what the split of spending was. It also includes the number of votes they gained, so you could do some handy analysis of spending vs seats gained, perhaps. There&rsquo;s lots of data in there, so what follows are excerpts, not the whole lot.</p>

<h2>Total spending</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at campaign spending first.</p>

<p>We had 8 candidates in the last election. During the long campaign (see yesterday&rsquo;s post), they were allowed to spend <strong>£30,429.48</strong>. During the short campaign, they were allowed to spend <strong>£12,579.48</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://plot.ly/~Floppy/1"><img src="/images/2010_horsham_campaign_spending.png" alt="2010 Horsham Campaign Spending" /></a></p>

<p>So, what can we learn from this?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The total cost of the campaign was not much over £11k for the highest-spending party. That&rsquo;s reassuring.</p></li>
<li><p>None of them spent anywhere near the maximum allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the spending happens in the short campaign; this makes sense, as that&rsquo;s when your mailouts happen, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The Green Party spent <em>nothing</em>. That explains why I never got a leaflet telling me about the candidate. I&rsquo;m going to ignore anyone else who suggests I&rsquo;ll split their vote now, as they quite obviously <em>aren&rsquo;t interested</em> here.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Where does the money go?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dig into a bit more detail on what that money is spent on. We&rsquo;ll just look at the Conservatives here, as they have the largest spend.</p>

<table class='table table-striped'>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> Category </th>
<th> Spend </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Advertising </td>
<td> £966.32 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Leaflets </td>
<td> £4,897.67 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Staff </td>
<td> £4,177.63 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Accommodation </td>
<td> £1,100.48 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>This is really interesting for my planning. The actual cost of getting a leaflet to (presumably) every home in the constituency (which has 77,000 voters) is <em>under £5k</em>. That&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> less than I expected, and should totally be crowdfundable. That&rsquo;s verified by the other parties as well &ndash; the Lib Dems spent a similar amount.</p>

<h2>Learning more</h2>

<p>This has given me some really useful insights. I&rsquo;d recommend having a dig into the figures for your area as well, you might find something interesting! I think this could be a good data-driven website as well &ndash; exposing this stuff through a nice data visualisation would be lovely; maybe a project for <a href="http://twitter.com/democlub">Democracy Club</a>?</p>

<p>You can dig into the data at the link above, and <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/163793/EPE-Part-3-Spending-and-donations-for-individual-candidates.pdf">this guide</a> from the Electoral Commission gives lots more detail on what it all means. It&rsquo;s for the 2014 EU elections, but the concepts are the same, so it&rsquo;s a decent reference. I&rsquo;ll be digging more into that guide as I go along, sorting out my own finances, so more of this to come.</p>

<p>Until next time&hellip;</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the archive for other posts.</em></p>

<p>So, today I spoke to the Electoral Commission. In my last post, I made a bunch of assumptions based on reading their website about what was legal and what wasn&rsquo;t. Today I checked all that with them, and was pretty much right, thankfully.</p>

<p>The Commission offices all have their <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/contact-us/our-offices">phone numbers online</a>, and connect you straight to people who can answer your questions. I highly recommend giving them a call if you&rsquo;re considering this yourself.</p>

<p>So, what did we find out? (By the way &ndash; don&rsquo;t take this as solid legal advice, it&rsquo;s just my own interpretation, not guaranteed fact)</p>

<h2>Standing</h2>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t many rules around actually standing. First of all, it&rsquo;s perfectly legal to announce that you intend to, as I have. You don&rsquo;t have to have anything &ldquo;official&rdquo; in place first.</p>

<p>The regulated campaigning period doesn&rsquo;t start until mid-December, so until then, you can do what you like. After that, things become a little more regulated financially, but more of that later.</p>

<p>As for registering as a candidate, or as a party, that all comes a lot later. The deadlines will be a few weeks before the election itself, so the official signing of things can be put off for a good while yet. Parties can be registered until a little while before the actual candidate nomination deadline, so we&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to decide if this gets branded with a party name or not.</p>

<h2>Spending</h2>

<p>There was a bit more around finances, but again this only takes effect during the regulated period. There is a period starting in mid-December called the &ldquo;Long Campaign&rdquo;, which changes to the &ldquo;Short Campaign&rdquo; nearer the actual election date. Each period has different spending limits, but I&rsquo;m not worrying about that too much yet.</p>

<p>You need to report all spending on the campaign to the Commission, but it&rsquo;s just a matter of keeping simple books of expenditure. No rocket science here, and in my case I&rsquo;m going to have it all open anyway. Again, this doesn&rsquo;t take effect until the start of the Long Campaign, but I&rsquo;ll probably start now anyway.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you start campaigning early, but don&rsquo;t officially register until later, the need to keep the books applies retroactively, so just get ahead and make sure you keep track from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Raising money</h2>

<p>This was the interesting bit.</p>

<p>You can raise money to spend during your campaign any way you like, but you must disclose who your donors are. For independent candidates, all donations over £50 must be disclosed &ndash; the figure for parties is higher, I think.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that all donors must be on the electoral roll, and <em>you</em> have to verify this. This makes crowdfunding interesting. Apparently some people have tried it, but found it very hard to get the right information to check that their donors are legal. I&rsquo;m hoping to start a conversation with crowdfunding organisations <em>now</em> to try to get this sorted out so I can do things that way.</p>

<p>To summarise, so far, the legalities around standing for election are pretty minimal. Just a bit of bookkeeping, and making sure your money comes from the right places. Should be even easier with the kind of radically transparent approach I&rsquo;ll be taking.</p>

<p>On to the next step!</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the archive for other posts.</em></p>

<p>A few days ago, I announced that <a href="/blog/2014/06/27/standing-for-parliament-in-2015">I intend to stand for Parliament next May</a>. Since then, I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of really great feedback (thank you all!), suggestions, and questions. Lots of questions have been about the process of standing, and about how complex it is.</p>

<p>The entertaining thing is that I&rsquo;ve had to answer most these with an &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, as I really don&rsquo;t at this stage. Really all I&rsquo;ve got so far is an intent, a lack of self-control, and am comfortable with the fact that <a href="http://codon.com/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing">I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/234/739/fa5.jpg" alt="I have no idea what I'm doing" /></p>

<p>However, my campaign is all about openness, so I&rsquo;m going to blog the whole thing as I go along and learn what&rsquo;s what. Watch this space, and I&rsquo;ll walk you through the entire process, and maybe remove some of the fear so that you can do it too. I&rsquo;ll also try to distill the knowledge into a guide of some sort as I go along &ndash; more on that later.</p>

<p>Here goes, anyway. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened up until now.</p>

<h2>Making the decision</h2>

<p>Step one in all this is perhaps the biggest. However, all you need is a desire to make the world better, to have the realisation that democracy needs people to stand up for what they believe in, and that if nobody else will do it, you&rsquo;d better take it on yourself.</p>

<p>You should have some idea what you want to stand for at this point, but I don&rsquo;t think it has to be final and polished. The joy of the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a> is that it will keep being refined and improved right up until the election (and beyond). It&rsquo;s essential to expose your ideas to some criticism and discussion though; it&rsquo;s a great way to refine them, and they <em>will</em> be challenged later.</p>

<p>A few people have asked why I&rsquo;m standing in Horsham, which will be a hard fight. Honestly, it never occurred to stand anywhere other than where I live &ndash; why would anyone vote for me if I have no connection with the area? The parachuting-in of candidates is one broken aspect of our system if you ask me. Anyway&hellip;</p>

<h2>Talking about it</h2>

<p>The first person I discussed it with was, of course, my wife Amanda, who would probably much rather I kept to myself, but knows me too well to expect me to. If this is something you&rsquo;re going to do, you&rsquo;ve got to have your family on board. I&rsquo;ve made a promise to her that I&rsquo;ll try to keep the time spent under control, and if this starts to have an effect on the time I spend with my children, then I&rsquo;ll stop. They come first. Obviously this will be hardest in the immediate run-up to the election, but it&rsquo;s the right aim to have.</p>

<p>Once she was on board, I told my bosses at the <a href="http://theodi.org">ODI</a>, and a few close friends with interests in the area. All the feedback was very positive, which was really great. Your extended networks will be a massive source of power and support, and far from getting the expected &ldquo;why the hell would you do that&rdquo; response, I&rsquo;ve had a massive outpouring of support, respect, and admiration for doing it. Win.</p>

<h2>Checking the law</h2>

<p>So, time to tell the world.</p>

<p>Hmm; perhaps I&rsquo;d better check it&rsquo;s legal first.</p>

<p>I spent a bit of time looking at the <a href="http://electoralcommission.org.uk">Electoral Commission</a> website, which looks nice but leads you in circles a bit, and doesn&rsquo;t currently have guidance for people standing in UK parliamentary elections in 2015. Obviously I&rsquo;m a bit ahead of the game here.</p>

<p>Cobbling together information from byelection guidance, and other sources,  it seems fairly simple. There are spending limits on election campaigning while you&rsquo;re a candidate, and some other rules, but the <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/162724/reg-period-timeline-candidate.pdf">actual time you are an official candidate is quite short</a>. There is something about a &ldquo;long campaign&rdquo; and a &ldquo;short campaign&rdquo; in there, but the rules only seem to apply once certain dates are passed. The long campaign starts in mid-December, so I&rsquo;m basically ignoring it for now. As far as I can tell, that&rsquo;s the only point that accounts and things have to be kept, though I am going to start keeping track of costs etc. now (in public of course).</p>

<p>So, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping you announcing an intention. When it comes to actually registering, you have to submit nomination papers with 10 signatures from your constituency, and a £500 deposit. The deadline is really quite close to the election itself though, so that&rsquo;s a long way off.</p>

<p>You get your deposit back if you gain 5% of the votes cast; in Horsham I think that&rsquo;s about 2800 based on the numbers at the last election. I intend to find a way to crowdfund that deposit, btw; not because I can&rsquo;t afford it, but to show others who can&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s not a barrier to participation.</p>

<h2>Time to announce</h2>

<p>So, I think it&rsquo;s legal to do what I&rsquo;m trying to do. I love working in the open, so I guess it&rsquo;s time to tell people! I wrote a blog post, but then realised that people might want to express an interest, so cobbled together a landing page at <a href="http://openhorsham.org.uk">openhorsham.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://mailchimp.com">mailchimp</a> mailing list, and a <a href="http://facebook.com/openhorsham">Facebook</a> page; both were easy to set up, and I should be fine on the free mailchimp plan for a long time. Both will let me get in touch with people who are interested in spreading the word. I&rsquo;m also trying out <a href="http://gosquared.com">GoSquared</a> to count website visitors &ndash; they promise not to share visitor data with others, so it&rsquo;s privacy-friendly.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I chose a Facebook page rather than a group. Facebook doesn&rsquo;t make it massively clear which is appropriate for what, but as this is a contact point for a <em>thing</em>, a page seemed more sensible.</p>

<p>Once that was up, I just needed to wait for the perfect time to launch&hellip;</p>

<p>Actually, no. There&rsquo;s no perfect time. I managed to wait about 10 minutes before I got so itchy about it that I had to just go ahead and publish.</p>

<p>The post went up here and on <a href="http://medium.com">medium</a>. I chose medium because there&rsquo;s no barrier to writing there, but I <em>think</em> people are more inclined to share their links than links to this site.</p>

<h2>What didn&rsquo;t I do?</h2>

<p>Because I did so little before announcing, there&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> I haven&rsquo;t done, but these are the big things that you might think you need first:</p>

<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t assemble a team of helpers. That can come later, and they will choose themselves.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t change my twitter handle (<a href="http://twitter.com/Floppy">@Floppy</a>) &ndash; I am who I am, I&rsquo;m not going to polish my public image.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t chase the media. I thought for a while that I had to, but was reminded that it wasn&rsquo;t my style, so would be the wrong thing to do. They will come to me if they&rsquo;re interested enough.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t agonise over a name for the campaign. I&rsquo;ve used Open Horsham for now, but that can change later &ndash; it&rsquo;s a work in progress.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s happened since?</h2>

<p>Well, today I had my first conversation with a local journalist, so that strategy worked.</p>

<p>Next steps are to get the message spread further (especially locally), and probably organise a get-together in a Horsham pub. I also need to get more content down in the manifesto and attract more contributors there. I&rsquo;ve also got to work out how far I can push the transparency &ndash; can I stream (or at least record and publish later) all the meetings and things I have with people, all the discussions? Someone suggested recording a making-of documentary as I go along. Anyone got a camera and a lot of free time?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very much taking a &ldquo;push it and see what breaks&rdquo; approach to this project, but it&rsquo;s always served me well in the past, so we&rsquo;ll see what happens this time!</p>

<p>Tune in next time to find out what happens when I phone up the South-East Electoral Commission team and see if my assumptions are actually right&hellip; :)</p>
