      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m intending to stand as an Independent candidate. I believe that candidates should be a lot more independent, and that parties, while useful for some things, tend to wield far too much power.</p>

<p>However, we find ourselves in a political climate that doesn&rsquo;t reward the independent, and doesn&rsquo;t allow lone voices through. Also, there are some built-in biases in the system against the independent candidate.</p>

<p>There has been an open question for a while on the OpenPolitics Manifesto over whether it should form a party. Some think we should, some not. I personally fall on the side that says that forming a party is a good thing, if only for short-term tactical reasons. It would be a party designed to make itself unnecessary by reforming the democratic system. The alternative view is that we would be better as a loose collection of independents.</p>

<p>This post is a long-form contribution to that debate, really.</p>

<p>In my view, the disadvantages of remaining independents mainly come down to brand awareness. When you have to get home a very simple strong message to as many people as possible, being able to present that in a unified way that people will come across in lots of places is a big advantage. Nuanced messages about being an independent but having a shared manifesto will get lost.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that parties get to have their party name, logo, and tagline on the ballot paper is a massive advantage to them over independents, who get none of that.</p>

<p>Anyway, a thought occurred to me. We want to remain a decentralised network of contributors, but capitalise on shared recognition and branding. How can we be a party without being a party? What if we register a party with the Electoral Commission, but avoid the use of the word &ldquo;Party&rdquo; like hell?</p>

<p>Instead, how about the <strong>OpenPolitics Network</strong>?</p>

<p>That way we get the best of both, I think. Anyone could stand as a candidate for the network as long as they are standing on the manifesto, but there&rsquo;s no central party control telling them what to do, or even <em>looking</em> like it does. Each candidate is free to run their campaign however they want; after all, they&rsquo;re basically independents.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rules state that parties do have to have some centralised aspects &ndash; a leader, and a couple of other posts, but these can be elected from the pool of contributors, and while they may <em>technically</em> exist, we can avoid using them in the usual way.</p>

<p>I think this might be a way to gain the advantages of party recognition without having to conform to the existing views of parties.</p>

<p>Oh, and there is no registered party in the UK at the moment that uses the word &ldquo;network&rdquo;, so I think that&rsquo;s a good omen.</p>

      <p>Dear Mr Maude,</p>

<p>I am writing to you today as one of your constituents, in relation to the imminent vote on the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill. The government&rsquo;s actions in this area give me great cause for concern.</p>

<p>In April, the EU Data Retention Directive was ruled as a breach of basic citizen rights by the European Courts of Justice. Too much data stored for too long, on too many people. Then, suddenly, last week, the DRIP Bill appears, ready to be pushed through with haste, due to an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; need to respond to this.</p>

<p>Firstly, what has changed since April? What requires upsetting the normal procedures of review and taking time over legislation? Civic society will not have sufficient time to inspect this legislation and object (though many are trying their best to analyse the text before it becomes law). How is there a sudden &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Secondly, you are a champion of transparency and accountability within government. How does the drafting of legislation in secret, even <em>with</em> cross-party consensus, square with that? Are citizens not to be trusted on matters such as this? I will be interested in seeing your vote on this, to see how far your commitment to transparency goes.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the bill itself gives much cause for concern. The initial claim was that it only reinstates existing powers (which, by the way, were declared illegal), but <a href="http://cyberleagle.blogspot.com/2014/07/dissecting-emergency-data-retention-and.html">analysis is suggesting</a> that it also extends that power to many other areas.</p>

<p>We are a democracy. We are a free country. Secretive extension of the surveillance state, done in haste without oversight, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2690181/David-Davis-devastating-attack-loss-privacy-This-data-law-catching-terrorists-lust-power.html">has no place here</a>. The government has a responsibility to balance the needs of security services against the freedoms of its citizens, which were hard-won over hundreds of years, and should not be limited lightly.</p>

<p>I announced a couple of weeks ago that <a href="/blog/2014/06/27/standing-for-parliament-in-2015/">I intend to stand for Horsham in next year&rsquo;s general election</a>, on a <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">collaborative and open-source political platform</a> built by normal citizens.</p>

<p>Horsham is my home, so my choice to stand was not <em>against you</em>, but rather <em>for Horsham</em>. However, with the government&rsquo;s actions over this bill, I am rather looking forward to challenging your choices and true commitment to openness and transparency over the next year.</p>

<p>Note: I have published this letter on my <a href="http://floppy.org.uk">personal website</a>, and will also publish your response to it, to give you proper right of reply.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,
James Smith</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>Tomorrow it will be 300 days until the General Election. <a href="/blog/2014/06/27/standing-for-parliament-in-2015/">I&rsquo;ve decided to stand</a>, and have been looking into the practicalities of it all (see the blog archive for more articles on this).</p>

<p>In this blog, I want to ask a question. I know that a lot of people out there are politically engaged, and are angry with the choices available to them. I see regular attacks on all the major parties, and a massive distaste for the rise of UKIP. So, the question is this:</p>

<p><em>What&rsquo;s stopping you?</em></p>

<p>Our democracy is far from perfect, but the way I see it, if you&rsquo;re angry with the choices available to you, you only have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take to the streets</li>
<li>Create your own alternative</li>
</ol>


<p>Note that &ldquo;tweet angrily&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t on there, and so unless you&rsquo;re taking option 1 and are going to camp out in Parliament Square in some kind of British Spring, you&rsquo;re left with option 2.</p>

<p>The great thing about our system is that you <em>can</em> create your own option, and the great thing about <em>now</em> is that that option is available to you in just 300 days&#8217; time.</p>

<p>Are you avoiding it because it&rsquo;s too complicated? Well, I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing, but I&rsquo;m working it all out as I go along in a series of blog posts, so that might help.</p>

<p>Is it because it won&rsquo;t make a difference? In a way, that&rsquo;s not the point. That&rsquo;s like saying you won&rsquo;t vote. The system <em>doesn&rsquo;t work</em> if people don&rsquo;t take part, and yes, most of them will lose, but that&rsquo;s how we decide together.</p>

<p>How about because the major parties have it all sewn up? Well, things are changing. With the web, social media, and other things that the majors don&rsquo;t really get, there is an amazing opportunity for disruption of the status quo. There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about how democracy will change in the future. Well, the future doesn&rsquo;t come unless someone <em>does it</em>, so let&rsquo;s do it.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know enough? Well, neither do they, I guarantee you; that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re surrounded by advisors. Fortunately we have advisors too &ndash; each other.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know what to actually stand for? There are plenty to pick from that you can join, or you can help the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a> project, an open-source election manifesto that anyone can edit. Taking part and holding your opinions up for inspection is a great way to refine and improve them, and you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> be simply shot down for saying something stupid; we all do that.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s left? That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just too much hard work?</p>

<p>Guess what. Like anything worth fighting for, democracy <em>is</em> hard work, and a long slog, but someone has to do it. However, the more of us do it, the greater support network we will have, and the wider we can spread the load.</p>

<p>Join me on the adventure, and we&rsquo;ll change the world. Maybe not this time, maybe not next, but if the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; political class is still running the country when we&rsquo;re old and grey, wouldn&rsquo;t that be a wasted opportunity?</p>
