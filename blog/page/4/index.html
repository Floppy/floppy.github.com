      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>Tomorrow it will be 300 days until the General Election. <a href="/blog/2014/06/27/standing-for-parliament-in-2015/">I&rsquo;ve decided to stand</a>, and have been looking into the practicalities of it all (see the blog archive for more articles on this).</p>

<p>In this blog, I want to ask a question. I know that a lot of people out there are politically engaged, and are angry with the choices available to them. I see regular attacks on all the major parties, and a massive distaste for the rise of UKIP. So, the question is this:</p>

<p><em>What&rsquo;s stopping you?</em></p>

<p>Our democracy is far from perfect, but the way I see it, if you&rsquo;re angry with the choices available to you, you only have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take to the streets</li>
<li>Create your own alternative</li>
</ol>


<p>Note that &ldquo;tweet angrily&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t on there, and so unless you&rsquo;re taking option 1 and are going to camp out in Parliament Square in some kind of British Spring, you&rsquo;re left with option 2.</p>

<p>The great thing about our system is that you <em>can</em> create your own option, and the great thing about <em>now</em> is that that option is available to you in just 300 days&#8217; time.</p>

<p>Are you avoiding it because it&rsquo;s too complicated? Well, I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing, but I&rsquo;m working it all out as I go along in a series of blog posts, so that might help.</p>

<p>Is it because it won&rsquo;t make a difference? In a way, that&rsquo;s not the point. That&rsquo;s like saying you won&rsquo;t vote. The system <em>doesn&rsquo;t work</em> if people don&rsquo;t take part, and yes, most of them will lose, but that&rsquo;s how we decide together.</p>

<p>How about because the major parties have it all sewn up? Well, things are changing. With the web, social media, and other things that the majors don&rsquo;t really get, there is an amazing opportunity for disruption of the status quo. There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about how democracy will change in the future. Well, the future doesn&rsquo;t come unless someone <em>does it</em>, so let&rsquo;s do it.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know enough? Well, neither do they, I guarantee you; that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re surrounded by advisors. Fortunately we have advisors too &ndash; each other.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know what to actually stand for? There are plenty to pick from that you can join, or you can help the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a> project, an open-source election manifesto that anyone can edit. Taking part and holding your opinions up for inspection is a great way to refine and improve them, and you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> be simply shot down for saying something stupid; we all do that.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s left? That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just too much hard work?</p>

<p>Guess what. Like anything worth fighting for, democracy <em>is</em> hard work, and a long slog, but someone has to do it. However, the more of us do it, the greater support network we will have, and the wider we can spread the load.</p>

<p>Join me on the adventure, and we&rsquo;ll change the world. Maybe not this time, maybe not next, but if the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; political class is still running the country when we&rsquo;re old and grey, wouldn&rsquo;t that be a wasted opportunity?</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>After talking to the electoral commission yesterday, I got interested in what local candidates normally spend on their campaigns.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is all open data. The Electoral Commission publish the statistics about election spending on their website, all under the Open Government License. All figures in this article come from them.</p>

<p>There is one particular dataset which we&rsquo;ll dive into here; the <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/uk-general-elections/candidate-election-spending">candidate spending in the 2010 general election</a>. This lists all candidates in the general election of 2010, what they spent, what they raised, and even better, what the split of spending was. It also includes the number of votes they gained, so you could do some handy analysis of spending vs seats gained, perhaps. There&rsquo;s lots of data in there, so what follows are excerpts, not the whole lot.</p>

<h2>Total spending</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at campaign spending first.</p>

<p>We had 8 candidates in the last election. During the long campaign (see yesterday&rsquo;s post), they were allowed to spend <strong>£30,429.48</strong>. During the short campaign, they were allowed to spend <strong>£12,579.48</strong>.</p>

<p>So, what can we learn from this?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The total cost of the campaign was not much over £11k for the highest-spending party. That&rsquo;s reassuring.</p></li>
<li><p>None of them spent anywhere near the maximum allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the spending happens in the short campaign; this makes sense, as that&rsquo;s when your mailouts happen, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The Green Party spent <em>nothing</em>. That explains why I never got a leaflet telling me about the candidate. I&rsquo;m going to ignore anyone else who suggests I&rsquo;ll split their vote now, as they quite obviously <em>aren&rsquo;t interested</em> here.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Where does the money go?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dig into a bit more detail on what that money is spent on. We&rsquo;ll just look at the Conservatives here, as they have the largest spend.</p>

<table class='table table-striped'>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> Category </th>
<th> Spend </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Advertising </td>
<td> £966.32 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Leaflets </td>
<td> £4,897.67 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Staff </td>
<td> £4,177.63 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Accommodation </td>
<td> £1,100.48 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>This is really interesting for my planning. The actual cost of getting a leaflet to (presumably) every home in the constituency (which has 77,000 voters) is <em>under £5k</em>. That&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> less than I expected, and should totally be crowdfundable. That&rsquo;s verified by the other parties as well &ndash; the Lib Dems spent a similar amount.</p>

<h2>Learning more</h2>

<p>This has given me some really useful insights. I&rsquo;d recommend having a dig into the figures for your area as well, you might find something interesting! I think this could be a good data-driven website as well &ndash; exposing this stuff through a nice data visualisation would be lovely; maybe a project for <a href="http://twitter.com/democlub">Democracy Club</a>?</p>

<p>You can dig into the data at the link above, and <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/163793/EPE-Part-3-Spending-and-donations-for-individual-candidates.pdf">this guide</a> from the Electoral Commission gives lots more detail on what it all means. It&rsquo;s for the 2014 EU elections, but the concepts are the same, so it&rsquo;s a decent reference. I&rsquo;ll be digging more into that guide as I go along, sorting out my own finances, so more of this to come.</p>

<p>Until next time&hellip;</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>So, today I spoke to the Electoral Commission. In my last post, I made a bunch of assumptions based on reading their website about what was legal and what wasn&rsquo;t. Today I checked all that with them, and was pretty much right, thankfully.</p>

<p>The Commission offices all have their <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/contact-us/our-offices">phone numbers online</a>, and connect you straight to people who can answer your questions. I highly recommend giving them a call if you&rsquo;re considering this yourself.</p>

<p>So, what did we find out? (By the way &ndash; don&rsquo;t take this as solid legal advice, it&rsquo;s just my own interpretation, not guaranteed fact)</p>

<h2>Standing</h2>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t many rules around actually standing. First of all, it&rsquo;s perfectly legal to announce that you intend to, as I have. You don&rsquo;t have to have anything &ldquo;official&rdquo; in place first.</p>

<p>The regulated campaigning period doesn&rsquo;t start until mid-December, so until then, you can do what you like. After that, things become a little more regulated financially, but more of that later.</p>

<p>As for registering as a candidate, or as a party, that all comes a lot later. The deadlines will be a few weeks before the election itself, so the official signing of things can be put off for a good while yet. Parties can be registered until a little while before the actual candidate nomination deadline, so we&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to decide if this gets branded with a party name or not.</p>

<h2>Spending</h2>

<p>There was a bit more around finances, but again this only takes effect during the regulated period. There is a period starting in mid-December called the &ldquo;Long Campaign&rdquo;, which changes to the &ldquo;Short Campaign&rdquo; nearer the actual election date. Each period has different spending limits, but I&rsquo;m not worrying about that too much yet.</p>

<p>You need to report all spending on the campaign to the Commission, but it&rsquo;s just a matter of keeping simple books of expenditure. No rocket science here, and in my case I&rsquo;m going to have it all open anyway. Again, this doesn&rsquo;t take effect until the start of the Long Campaign, but I&rsquo;ll probably start now anyway.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you start campaigning early, but don&rsquo;t officially register until later, the need to keep the books applies retroactively, so just get ahead and make sure you keep track from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Raising money</h2>

<p>This was the interesting bit.</p>

<p>You can raise money to spend during your campaign any way you like, but you must disclose who your donors are. For independent candidates, all donations over £50 must be disclosed &ndash; the figure for parties is higher, I think.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that all donors must be on the electoral roll, and <em>you</em> have to verify this. This makes crowdfunding interesting. Apparently some people have tried it, but found it very hard to get the right information to check that their donors are legal. I&rsquo;m hoping to start a conversation with crowdfunding organisations <em>now</em> to try to get this sorted out so I can do things that way.</p>

<p>To summarise, so far, the legalities around standing for election are pretty minimal. Just a bit of bookkeeping, and making sure your money comes from the right places. Should be even easier with the kind of radically transparent approach I&rsquo;ll be taking.</p>

<p>On to the next step!</p>
