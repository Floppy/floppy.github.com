</p>
<p>
It’s been an interesting year. Until April I worked at AMEE as their Platform
Evangelist. I’d been there almost four years, through lots of interesting times.
I got to do cool things like build AskAMEE, hack carbon emissions into Minecraft
(and get on BoingBoing with it), and run the London Green Hackathon. It was sad
when my time there came to an end, but in startup life there is always a point at
which it makes sense to move on.
</p>
<p>
Since then, I’ve been trying to find ways to carry making software that at least
tries to deal with the impending climate crisis that’s heading our way. As I discussed
at the beginning of the year, we don’t have long. I’ve been carrying on building
the Cleanweb UK community that we tried to bootstrap at AMEE on a voluntary basis.
London seems to have the most interesting cleanweb community in the world - we’ve
certainly been doing it longer than anyone else, so we have to capitalise on that
and work together!
</p>
<p>
However, the time has come for me to try and make a living out of this stuff again,
and I’m having a go at doing it by myself.
</p>
<p>
So, meet <a href="http://www.therm.uk.com">Therm</a>. It’s the first specialist cleanweb consultancy in the world (as
far as I know). If you’re doing anything on the web to do with sustainability, Therm
can help - get in touch!
</p>
<p>
It’s just me for now, but maybe later it won’t be. It’ll be an adventure, whatever
happens.

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2012/05/23/green-is-useless-to-me/">Green Is Useless To Me</a></h1>
      <p>The other day I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Geek-Manifesto-ebook/dp/B007T99H6S" title="The Geek Manifesto">The Geek Manifesto</a>, by Mark Henderson, and, given my particular interests, I started near the end with the chapter on <em>Geeks and Greens</em> before starting properly at the beginning.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest reading it, but to summarise, the traditional green movement is generally unscientific and deeply political, and this has led to counterproductive politicisation and scepticism of scientific issues like climate change.</p>
<p>The greens latched onto a few things correctly by accident, like climate change research, but are still vastly wrong on many others. They come with too much junk science to be credible, and this leaks into the real science that they accidentally picked up. The association of the Green Party, for instance, with homeopathy and other alternative medicine approaches, is just sad in this day and age (although I believe it changed recently, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if the party still includes many who do believe this junk).</p>
<p>Add to that that many traditional greens have far-left politics which puts a lot of people off, and you end up with the conclusion that they *cannot* be trusted to be the main voice on important matters of science like climate change, which should essentially be an apolitical issue.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s NGOs like Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, or political parties like the Green Party here in the UK, they are just too embedded in their history to be able to deal with this properly. They can&#8217;t give up their hatred of nuclear power, for instance, or their opposition to GM science, both of which are probably going to be essential tools for our future, without alienating their core membership.</p>
<p>I agree with Mark that a new approach is needed, but I don&#8217;t think those organisations can be rescued &#8216;from the inside&#8217; as he suggests. They can carry on if they like, but even in the unlikely event that they change their views, the public&#8217;s perception of them would still be the same. We need something new, something reality-based, something that aims to have the clean high-tech future that I <em>personally</em> want.</p>
<p>Even the word &#8216;green&#8217; is now rendered useless by these viewpoints, so we have to just drop it and talk about &#8216;sustainability&#8217; and &#8216;clean&#8217; instead. If someone could come up with a catchy name for it that&#8217;s half as good as &#8216;green&#8217; though, that would be lovely.</p>

      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I went along to ISIC in Harwell to take part in the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a>, run by NASA. Hackdays are always fun, but this one was particularly exciting, because, you know, SPACE!</p>
<p>At first I thought about doing something with Earth observation data and climate change, but decided I&#8217;d give myself a break from that and do something else for once. After the usual shenanigans forming a team, a few of us started working on something to do with exoplanet data, particularly from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(spacecraft)" title="Kepler">Kepler satellite</a>.</p>
<p>We know about tons of planets now, but most people don&#8217;t know much about them. We decided to make something a bit fun and a bit educational. My sister is a physics teacher, so we aimed at creating something she could use in class to stimulate questions from the kids.</p>
<p>The result is <a href="http://www.planethopper.co.uk" title="Planet Hopper">Planet Hopper</a>, a webapp that allows you to explore the exoplanets and see various interesting facts about them in a friendly way. For instance, we tell you how old you would be on the planet, hoping to stimulate the question &#8216;why?&#8217;</p>
<p>We ended up winning the best hack prize at the Harwell site, and are currently in the global judging round, which is always nice.</p>
<p>Technically, this was my first experience with Django. In general, my first assessment was that it seemed perfectly capable, but not as slick as the Rails toolset perhaps. I&#8217;ll keep playing with it though, it&#8217;s always good to know more!</p>
<p>If you want to improve Planet Hopper, you can do; the code is, as always, <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/kepler-explorer" title="Code">on github</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: We won in the global judging! <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/blog/2012/05/18/global-winners-announced/">&#8220;Most Inspiring&#8221;</a> - pretty sweet! </p>
