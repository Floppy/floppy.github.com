      <p>Today is apparently <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/world-mental-health-day/">World Mental Health Day</a>, which makes it an appropriate time to talk a little about depression. I was thinking of doing this anyway, but today seems a good day to do it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve suffered from intermittent depression for the last few years. If I&rsquo;ve been quiet on Twitter or GitHub for the last couple of weeks, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m currently recovering from my fourth round; they seem to come on just under every two years, it seems. It&rsquo;s not a pleasant thing to admit to, but I honestly believe that only by talking about our experiences can we normalise this, and when you&rsquo;re in the grip of depression, what you really need is to know that you are <em>not alone</em>.</p>

<p>The first time round, I didn&rsquo;t really understand what was happening. Work was stressful, but not ridiculously so, but I lost the ability to cope with it. I couldn&rsquo;t make decisions, and I remember times when I would have to run away and actually <em>hide in a darkened room</em> for a while when something tricky came up like, I dunno, triaging the Monday morning bug list. Fortunately I worked for a flight simulation company at the time, so dark rooms were in plentiful supply.</p>

<p>Depression, for someone who works entirely in their mind, as we do as creative programmers, is utterly debilitating. Imagine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your mind slows down</li>
<li>You lose the ability to focus, or think straight about problems</li>
<li>You lose the ability to make decisions; even deciding on lunch can be impossible</li>
<li>You lose confidence; feel like you&rsquo;re a fraud, and that you&rsquo;ll be found out</li>
<li>You lose the big picture; you can&rsquo;t hold it all in your head</li>
<li>Anxiety builds, and eventually you find yourself hiding in darkened rooms trying not to panic (and often failing)</li>
</ul>


<p>Our jobs depend on those exact qualities, and often, for many of us, so does our self-worth. I try to compare it to being a sportsman and having a broken leg; it&rsquo;s take you out of the game just as surely, and it robs you of your reason for being just as much.</p>

<p>However; it is manageable. I&rsquo;m still learning, but I am getting better at it. I&rsquo;m spotting it earlier each time, am getting better at warning my co-workers, and have no qualms now with going to the doctor and getting the help I need once it becomes clear. I&rsquo;ve had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram">medication</a> the last three times; I&rsquo;m currently a week and a half in to this round.</p>

<p>The important thing to realise that <em>it&rsquo;s not a failing, it&rsquo;s an illness</em>. Your brain is a big bag of chemicals that govern your emotions; there&rsquo;s no magical soul hiding there, I&rsquo;m afraid. But sometimes those chemicals go wrong. In the case of depression, it&rsquo;s apparently a long-term reduction in the amount of Serotonin in the brain that does it. Your synapses hoover up too much, so there&rsquo;s not enough left in the gaps to conduct the signals effectively. It can be brought on by stress, by exhaustion, by sudden shocks, or even by a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; illness. The brain gets out of kilter, and then just gets <em>stuck</em> in this cycle.</p>

<p>But, as an engineer, <em>I can relate to this</em>. Depression is a <em>bug</em>, not a failure on <em>my</em> part. The medication prevents this serotonin reuptake, and lets your brain recover, and remember how to balance itself. I&rsquo;ve proved this to myself time and again; a few days into the medication, I&rsquo;m <em>back</em>. I&rsquo;m me again. For example, I couldn&rsquo;t have written this two days ago, but today I&rsquo;m feeling more&hellip; <em>present</em>. I&rsquo;m not there yet, but it won&rsquo;t be long now.</p>

<p>The people around you have a huge part to play. You need their understanding, support, and for them to give you time to recover. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to cope with this if not for my family, my colleagues at <a href="http://amee.com">AMEE</a> and the <a href="http://www.theodi.org">ODI</a>, and for a great friend of mine who, many years ago, taught me how depression works <em>before</em> I found out for myself.</p>

<p>There are a few links I&rsquo;d recommend reading about this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://revdancatt.com/2012/07/26/leaving-the-guardian-creativity-vs-mild-depression-the-quantified-self-and-running/">Leaving the Guardian, Creativity vs Mild Depression</a> by Rev Dan Catt</li>
<li><a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html">Adventures in Depression</a> and <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/depression-part-two.html">Part 2</a> by Hyperbole and a Half</li>
</ul>


<p>That was a bit long, but the TL;DR is this: If you&rsquo;re feeling the symptoms above, then talk to your doctor and <em>get help</em>. It&rsquo;s just a bug, it&rsquo;s fixable, and you are <em>not</em> a failure. If you know someone who seems to be suffering, then try to help them understand what&rsquo;s happening, don&rsquo;t just tell them to &ldquo;cheer up&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>I find the current state of politics in the UK incredibly depressing.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I find myself disagreeing with most of what the Conservative party is doing in government, and in particular with the narrative they are using to justify it. The Liberal Democrats may claim they have moderated the worst excesses of the Conservatives, but have still allowed the near-privatisation of the NHS, and failed utterly to do anything with the concessions they got in the coalition agreement on things like electoral reform.</p>

<p>On the opposition side&hellip; well, what opposition? I personally like Ed, but it&rsquo;s obvious the media have their teeth into him and will never let him have a proper voice. Worst of all, the Labour Party are buying into the aforementioned narrative of &ldquo;this is what needs to be done&rdquo;. They don&rsquo;t challenge the demonisation of the poor, while entrenched power runs off with the money that&rsquo;s being stripped from our welfare state.</p>

<p>Protest votes are heading to the charismatic far right, with the Old Tory caricatures that are UKIP grabbing all the headlines and dragging the entire country down a path that we <em>really</em> shouldn&rsquo;t be considering. The other minor parties are next to useless. The Greens, really the party I agree with most, will always be mired in 1970&rsquo;s style environmentalism, which nobody will ever vote for en masse.</p>

<p>All this adds up to an uncomfortable truth. Nobody in the public sphere in this country is speaking for <em>me</em>. The narrative is about how the past was better, and the present is broken. The people in power seem to lust after the old days of empire, rather than working out how to take us into a bright shiny future.</p>

<p>The problem is; the future isn&rsquo;t stopping. It will change <em>every single institution we have</em>, and we should be getting excited about that fact and making sure it works <em>for</em> us. That&rsquo;s what I dedicate my life to, to making sure the future is a <em>better</em> place for <em>everyone</em>, but nobody in power seems to want to take us there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="/blog/2009/11/10/the-activist-geek-philosophy">written before</a> about a kind of shared philosophy amongst the open society community, but I stopped short of some of the more controversial areas of politics. I think it&rsquo;s time for us to stop doing that. There is an unspoken tradition in our community of trying to be beyond political statements, to fix things from the outside, but the way GDS are reforming the civil service (which I <em>will</em> give the Conservatives credit for, or at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Maude">some of them</a>) has reminded me that in order to truly change the system, you sometimes have to <em>become</em> the system.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a general election coming in a couple of years. Those of us who are looking to the future should have our hands in the game. It&rsquo;s time for our community to grow up, take responsibility, and stop leaving the debate to the relics. We have the tools and the skills to do this, and a lot of allies. We&rsquo;re already changing the world from behind the scenes; it&rsquo;s time to start leading from the front as well.</p>

<p>If someone is already doing something about this, I want to know who. If not, we should get started by setting up a GitHub repository, and get collaborating on policy for a brighter future.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2013/06/04/my-mentoring-journey/">My Mentoring Journey</a></h1>
      <p>Since January, I&rsquo;ve worked at the <a href="http://www.theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a>, which has been a really great experience. As well as being a non-profit with a mission to make the world better, which is already a huge win as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the organisation also puts a massive emphasis on culture and people. For a small enterprise (less than 20 people), this is amazing, and I&rsquo;ve never seen anything quite like it anywhere I&rsquo;ve worked.</p>

<p>One major part of the culture is the approach to mentoring. Not content with just professional training, the ODI wants all employees to have access to a mentor outside the company, to help develop people in ways that <em>they</em> need, not necessarily in ways that obviously benefit the organisation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that I drifted through my professional life in a kind of random walk, without much of a plan. Admittedly, working at the ODI brings together so much of what I&rsquo;ve done over the years that it might <em>look</em> intentional, but it&rsquo;s really just another convenient accident. However, at 37, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to start trying to steer a little. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to get an answer to the classic interview question &ldquo;where do you see yourself in five years&#8217; time?&rdquo;. Because the ODI is about building a movement, a community, it&rsquo;s OK if the answer to the question is &ldquo;not here&rdquo;. People leaving the ODI and starting their own businesses is a Good Thing in a way it wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere else.</p>

<p>So, where do I want to be? Well, barring career discontinuities, I reckon I should be CTOing somewhere that&rsquo;s making a difference to the things I care about, somewhere in the openness, transparency, democracy, environmental impact sort of area, rather than day-to-day hacking. Maybe that&rsquo;s still the ODI, but if so I should look to be doing more of the strategic stuff by then.</p>

<p>Problem is, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s missing in order for me to get there. Technically, I can do anything I can turn my hand to, but I know there are deeper mysteries that I know nothing about, but that are important in the wider context of a CTO type role.</p>

<p>The mentoring program is a perfect framework to start thinking about this. I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough find a mentor who has gone through the transition from pure hacker to something a bit more strategic in the shape of <a href="http://flourish.org">Francis Irving</a>, ex of <a href="http://mysociety.org">MySociety</a> and now CEO of <a href="http://scraperwiki.com">ScraperWiki</a>. We share many of our ideals, and I hope I can learn a lot from someone who is a little further down the path than me.</p>

<p>Neither of us really know how this process will work, but we&rsquo;re starting with a bit of set reading (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator's_Dilemma">The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma</a> by Clayton M. Christensen) and seeing how it evolves. As we go along, I&rsquo;m going to try to share my thoughts and learning in public, partly as a way of marshalling my own thoughts, and partly as a way to pay Francis&#8217; generosity forward to others.</p>

<p>It will be an adventure, and hopefully I will come out of it with a better understanding both of myself, and my role in the better future I hope to build.</p>
