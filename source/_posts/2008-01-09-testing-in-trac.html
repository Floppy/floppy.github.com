Hurrah, I&#8217;ve just contributed my first code back to the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> project. I&#8217;ve created a workflow for the 0.11 release which adds a simple &#8220;testing" state to tickets before they are closed. For the Trac addicts amongst you, it&#8217;s available at <a href="http://trac-hacks.swapoff.org/wiki/TestingWorkflow">Trac Hacks</a>. I&#8217;m rather proud of it, because it&#8217;s actually the first workflow hack on the site!
