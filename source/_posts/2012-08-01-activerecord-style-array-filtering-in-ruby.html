title: ActiveRecord-style array filtering in Ruby
tags:

<p>Rails&#8217; named scopes are fantastic for making readable code with efficient SQL behind the scenes. Given a Person model, you could define a scope called &#8216;adult&#8217; which could add an SQL <em>WHERE</em> for <em>age&gt;18</em>, and let you write pretty code like Person.adult to find all adults. Great! Chaining them together gets even better with code like Person.adult.male.with_glasses.</p>
<p>The problem comes if you do this in a single action with lots of different chained scopes to show different data. You end up with a whole bunch of SQL queries, which can get expensive. In the system I&#8217;m currently building, which includes geospatial queries, this gets far too slow to use. So, instead, let&#8217;s get one big list of objects and filter them in Ruby when we need them.</p>
<p>Simple enough. The only thing is, the ActiveRecord chaining syntax is lovely. I don&#8217;t want to write tons of chained selects with blocks and all that faff. Instead, let&#8217;s extend Array to give us the syntax we like. The trick is to wrap an Array inside another class and then use method_missing to delegate. We then make sure that returned objects aren&#8217;t Arrays, but our new type instead.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best explained with the code:</p>
