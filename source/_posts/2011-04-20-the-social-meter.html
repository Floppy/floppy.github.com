I went along with <a href="http://www.floppy.org.uk/2010/10/25/rewired-state-a-social-energy-monitor">an idea</a>,  and even better actually got to build it! We got a great team together,  and despite initial technical teething problems, had a demo running in  time for the show and tell at the end (by the skin of our teeth). I’ve  been meaning to write it up for ages, but instead, I decided to make a  video.</p>
<p>The code is, as ever, available on <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/socialmeter">Github</a>, and there are other writeups on <a href="http://www.e-ssociation.net/blog/?p=59">Paul Tanner’s blog</a> and the <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/projects/social-meter">Rewired State site</a>.</p>
