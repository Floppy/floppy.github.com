<p>
My server runs Ubuntu, and seeing as 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) is out, I thought &#8220;woo, let&#8217;s upgrade". Bad idea. Well, partly. Most of the upgrade went fine, but there was one problem. Intrepid comes with Ruby 1,8.7, which works fine with Rails &gt;=2.1, but doesn&#8217;t work with anything lower. Mephisto, on the other hand, doesn&#8217;t work with Rails 2.1 yet, and is only usable with Rails 

</p><p><code lang="text" theme="zenburnesque">
NoMethodError (undefined method `[]' for #<:enumerator:0x2aaaad5f7a58>)
</:enumerator:0x2aaaad5f7a58></code>
</p><p>
So, I was faced with having to downgrade to Ruby 1.8.6 (a royal pain as Intrepid doesn&#8217;t provide packages for it), or &#8220;fix" Mephisto to work with 2.1 (oh my god, don&#8217;t even get me started). Fortunately, another solution presented itself.

I came across <a href="http://bicosyes.com/rails-2-1-con-ruby-1-8-7-broken/">this blog post</a> which describes the problem I was having. The gist (it&#8217;s in Spanish) is that the main problem with Rails 2.0.2 and Ruby 1.8.7 is that Ruby 1.8.7 has added a String#chars function to the core language. Rails also adds this function, but the two have different return types, hence causing much breakage. The solution? Remove Ruby&#8217;s String#chars and let Rails do its thing. Add this code to an initializer in your Rails 2.0.2 app, and it will work (better, at least) with Ruby 1.8.7.
</p>
<p>
<code lang="ruby" theme="zenburnesque">
begin
  String.class_eval { remove_method :chars }
rescue NameError
end
</code>

As you can tell by the fact that you&#8217;re reading this blog, it works a treat. Hurrah!

EDIT: Another solution, which I only just worked out, would be to install the very badly-named <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a>, which sits alongside the system&#8217;s Ruby and is call-compatible with 1.8.6. This makes a lot of sense if you&#8217;re using passenger (mod_rails), as well.
