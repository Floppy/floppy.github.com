Although a bit pricey, it's an [IFTTT enabled](https://ifttt.com/flic) physical button ([also works with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/flic/integrations) ).\r\n\r\nDisclosure: I've never tried the button, so please do not read this as a recommendation, merely as input :-)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMichael"
