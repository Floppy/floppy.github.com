message: "Hi there \r\n \r\nAt https://www.realmoney.ca, the top question our Ottawa-based experienced scrutineers get asked most  is almost certainly: “What’s the best online casino site for gamers in Canada?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we regularly compile a list of websites ranked by their features – some of them specific to Canadians – and keep it constantly up to date. These include items such as the availability of free customer service numbers, big welcome bonuses, totally free slots spins, fast payouts and Canada-friendly banking choices. \r\n \r\nAdded to that, we also study closely promos, jackpots and the selection of apps on the leading online casinos to make sure you get the best experience. \r\n \r\nTo ensure your safety and fun, we keep a blacklist of casinos that do not measure up to our exacting selection standards. Sites which fall short of the tests for confidentiality, software quality, customer-support, finance and reliability find themselves on our “naughty list”. There are even some household names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/jackpot-win.jpg\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, here are just a few of the worst examples from our ”list of death” which we urge you to not visit under any circumstances. \r\n \r\nFrom British Columbia to Newfoundland, everyone knows Canada is the best place to be. But it’s also one of the best places to reside if you’re a gaming fan, and not just because of our country’s plentiful choice of quality online gaming sites – each with their own unique range of apps providing to its citizens. \r\n \r\nA lot of these, including slots, on-line poker and blackjack have even developed their own individual following and communities of  Canadian players players that like to play and talk about it together online. \r\n \r\nIt should be no surprise that Canadians also adore betting on sports, especially the NHL, and everything hockey related such as international tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother favourite target foronline-gamers is playing the official state-run online lottery games! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you personal experience of internet-gambling sites?
