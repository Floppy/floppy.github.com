message: "Good Day \r\n \r\nAt https://www.realmoney.ca, the one question our Halifax-based online consumer panel gets asked more than any other  is: “What’s the best internet casino site for Canadian gamers?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we regularly compile a list of sites ranked by their features – including those specific to the experience of Canadians – and make sure it’s constantly up to date. These include items like options for toll-free customer assistance numbers, tasty welcome bonuses, absolutely free slots spins, radid payouts and Canada-specific banking solutions. \r\n \r\nIn addition, we also examine specials, top prizes and the range of video games on the leading online casinos to ensure you get an enjoyable experience. \r\n \r\nTo ring-fence your safety and fun, we keep a blacklist of gaming sites that do not comply with our strict guidelines. Casinos which fail the rules for confidentiality, software quality, customer-engagement, finance and reliability will end up on our blacklist. There are even some big names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/Rainbow-Riches.jpg\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, here are just some of the nastiest examples from our ”list of death” which we recommend you should give a miss. \r\n \r\nFrom Alberta to Yukon, everyone knows Canada is the best country on earth. But it’s also one of the best places to live if you’re a gaming fan, and not just because of our country’s plentiful choice of quality online gaming sites – each with their own unique range of games providing to its people. \r\n \r\nMany of these, including slots, online poker and blackjack have even created their own personal following and communities of Canada-based devotees that like to play and talk about it together online. \r\n \r\nIt’s probably no surprise that Canadians also adore betting on sports, especially the NHL, and everything hockey related such as Global tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother popular target forinternet-gamblers is playing the official state-run online lotteries! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you personal experience of internet-gambling sites? We’re anxious to hear from you so we can improve our selection criteria. For more information just click the link above."
