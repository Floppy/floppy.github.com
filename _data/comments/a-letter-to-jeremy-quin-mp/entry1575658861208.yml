message: "Hi guys \r\n \r\nHere at https://www.realmoney.ca, the one thing our Toronto-based trained evaluation team gets asked most  is almost certainly: “What is the best internet casino site for Canadian gamers?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we regularly compile a list of sites ranked by their features – some specific to the Canadian experience – and keep it constantly up to date. These include things like the availability of toll-free customer service numbers, massive welcome bonuses, no cost slots spins, speedy payouts and Canada-specific banking choices. \r\n \r\nAdditionally, we  also study closely promotions, top prizes and the choice of video games on the leading gaming sites to make sure you have an enjoyable time. \r\n \r\nTo lock in your security and enjoyment, we keep a blacklist of casinos that fail to comply with our tough conditions. Sites that fail our tests for confidentiality, software quality, user-engagement, finance and reliability find themselves on our blacklist. There are even some household names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/real-money-casino.jpg?x76036\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, these are just three of the nastiest sites from our ”list of death” which we urge you to give a miss. \r\n \r\nFrom Winsor to Vancouver, everyone knows Canada is the world’s number one nation. But it’s also one of the best places to be if you’re a gambling fan, and not just because of the great range of quality online casinos – each with their own unique range of apps catering to its citizens. \r\n \r\nMany of these, such as slots, online poker and blackjack have even created a dedicated following and communities of Canada-based devotees that like to play and discuss the game online. \r\n \r\nIt’s probably no surprise that Canadians also love betting on sports, especially the NHL, and everything hockey related such as international tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother popular target forinternet-gamers is playing the official state-run online lottery games! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you personal experience of internet-gambling sites? We’re keen to get your opinion so we can fine tune our selection criteria. For more info just follow the link above."
