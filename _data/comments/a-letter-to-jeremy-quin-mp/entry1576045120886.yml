message: "Good Day \r\n \r\nAt https://www.realmoney.ca, the big thing our Vancouver-based online scrutineers get asked most  is almost certainly: “What’s the best on-line casino for Canadian gamblers?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we’ve created a list of sites ranked by their features – some specific to Canadians – and keep it constantly refreshed. These include items like options for free customer service numbers, enticing welcome bonuses, absolutely free slots spins, no-strings payouts and Canada-specific banking choices. \r\n \r\nIn addition, we also look into promotions, top prizes and the range of apps on the top gaming sites to ensure you receive a great time. \r\n \r\nTo guarantee your safety and fun, we keep a blacklist of casinos that do not meet with our strict selection criteria. Sites which fail our tests for security, software quality, customer-care, finance and reliability find themselves on our “naughty list”. There are even some big names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/jackpot-win.jpg\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, here are just some of the worst sites from our “list of shame” which we urge you to avoid. \r\n \r\nFrom Alberta to Yukon, everyone knows Canada is the best nation on earth . But it’s also one of the top places to be if you’re a gambling fan, and not just because of the great range of quality online casinos – each with their own unique range of plays providing to its people. \r\n \r\nMany of these, such as slots, online poker and blackjack have even created their own personal following as well as communities of Canada-based enthusiasts that like to play and discuss the game online. \r\n \r\nIt’s probably no shock that Canadians also love betting on sports, especially the NHL, and everything hockey related such as international tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother favourite target forinternet-gamers is playing the official state-run online lotteries! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you own experience of internet-gambling websites? We’re anxious to hear from you so we can improve our selection criteria. For more info just click the link above."
