      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>One thing you really need to know when standing as a candidate is what areas are actually part of your constituency. Constituencies are pretty weird shapes, especially out in the country, and the area is probably larger than you think. So, time to find out for sure.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Ordnance Survey makes this easy. Their <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/">Election Maps</a> service shows all the constituency, ward, and other boundaries you might want in a nice map format. Enter your constituency name in the box, choose the right one, and you get something like this (apologies for the screenshot, there&rsquo;s no way to embed):</p>

<p><img src="/images/horsham_constituency.png" alt="Horsham constituency OS map" /></p>

<p>Now, what I really want is a map on my wall that I can refer to easily. The Election Maps service does have a print option, but it&rsquo;s just to print a single page yourself, and no way is that good enough for what I want.</p>

<p>Fortunately, OS come to the rescue again with their <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/custom-made-maps.html">custom map printing</a>. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no link on the election maps to &ldquo;order a custom map of this area&rdquo; (which would be awesome, OS, if you&rsquo;re listening) so we have to do it manually.</p>

<p>In my case, I found a point roughly in the middle of the constituency&rsquo;s bounding box, Lower Beeding, and I found that at Landranger scale (1:50000), the whole constituency would fit on one map. This probably won&rsquo;t always be the case, but it worked for me. Â£16.99 and 5 days later, and I have an 80x80cm wall map of my constituency is hanging on my wall:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wall_map.jpg" alt="Horsham constituency wall map" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, that custom map doesn&rsquo;t include the boundary of the constituency, so I had to draw it on with a highlighter pen, but it&rsquo;s not a bad solution.</p>

<p>Note: I tried to do this using OpenStreetMap, but I just couldn&rsquo;t work out how. If anyone knows, then please tell me, I&rsquo;d love to have a method of using the open data in OSM to plan my campaigning :)</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/08/05/horsham-election-meetup-1/">Horsham Election Meetup #1</a></h1>
      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>Last night was our first Horsham election meetup, and while very useful, it&rsquo;s left so many thoughts swirling around my brain that it&rsquo;s hard to get them in any kind of order. These, I think, were the main outcomes for me:</p>

<h2>Independent movement</h2>

<p>There is a growing movement of independent candidates across Horsham, with myself at national level, and a number of others at district level. With all the seats up for election at the same time next year, there&rsquo;s a lot of possible cooperation to be had. There is a general disillusionment with our representatives at all levels, that they are not representing the concerns of residents, which plays into the hands of independents.</p>

<p>However, a danger here is that if there is a movement of independent local councillor candidates, that I get drawn into that <em>too far</em>, and don&rsquo;t get enough focus on the specific needs of the MP campaign. This is dangerous, not least because Horsham district and constituency are not the same shape; some of my constituents are in Mid Sussex District, and not all Horsham District residents vote in Horsham constituency.</p>

<p>But, it will be helpful to have allies; we&rsquo;ve set up a mailing list for independents in the Horsham area &ndash; if you want to join, visit the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/horsham-unparty">Horsham Unparty google group</a>.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>We discussed the most important issues to Horsham right now, and I&rsquo;m glad to say that they were pretty much in line with my expectations. Gatwick expansion is a biggie, but the main concern at the moment seems to be around the planning and development going on around the town. Housing needs to be built, but it&rsquo;s not being built in a way that local people are happy with. They feel that their views are ignored, and that decisions are being taken behind closed doors.</p>

<p>Both these play nicely into my national stance on greater transparency at all levels, environmental issues around airports and vehicles, and fixing the democratic process. It&rsquo;ll be important in the campaign to keep my focus on the national-level trends and laws that make local problems worse, while trying to facilitate solutions to local problems. The advantage of having a group of independent candidates for the council is that we can have good coverage of whatever level is actually responsible for an issue.</p>

<p>My action from this is to start creating a set of local issue pages on <a href="http://openhorsham.org.uk">openhorsham.org.uk</a> and set out my views and how they link to national legislation, etc.</p>

<h2>Campaign planning</h2>

<p>We discussed how to engage with people during the campaign. We threw around ideas of town centre engagement on a Saturday morning, and running local surgeries around the constituency. We talked about engaging with influential local groups (and being explicit about getting endorsements!), and also about increasing the number of election hustings meetings &ndash; last time round, there were two, both run by church groups. We need to improve that this time.</p>

<p>We also talked about getting a team together to help. Volunteers for leaflet dropping are essential, but it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly clear to me that I need other people involved on my campaign to help run and organise it. How to find all these people? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>Engagement with local media is important. I need to be writing opinion pieces and letters on a regular basis. I have no problem with writing (I don&rsquo;t think), but my instinct is always to publish immediately online; I will have to restrain myself slightly to get anything visible in the local paper.</p>

<h2>Too Much Information</h2>

<p>There is always a danger that as a new entrant into the democratic arena, there are many many people out there who know a lot more than you about the area, the process, and the politics. These people are <em>great</em>, but they do leave your head spinning. It&rsquo;s important to take what is useful on board, but not allow yourself to be subsumed into the stream of information.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, to be a genuine candidate, I have to be <em>myself</em>, and not try to turn myself into an expert politician. So far, while there are massive gaps in my knowledge, my instincts have been confirmed, so I feel like I&rsquo;m on the right track.</p>

<p>It will be an interesting year. Balancing the different aspects will be hard, but I need to make sure I remain focused on representing what the constituents want from their MP, and making sure they understand what I have to offer. <em>Everything</em> else is negotiable.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week more licenses were handed out for oil and gas extraction under the UK, and if you live in the Horsham area, it&rsquo;s very likely that <a href="https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/eng/fox/decc/PED300X/licence?LICENCE_TYPE=PEDL&amp;LICENCE_NO=243">Celtique Energie</a> or <a href="https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/eng/fox/decc/PED300X/licence?LICENCE_TYPE=PEDL&amp;LICENCE_NO=244">Cuadrilla</a> now have a right to extract the resources under your home. Also, the government are currently <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/underground-drilling-access">in the process of changing the law</a> so that you won&rsquo;t have the right to object to this if it happens.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to object to fracking &ndash; some good, some bad &ndash; but the one that concerns me most is that <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21577097-either-governments-are-not-serious-about-climate-change-or-fossil-fuel-firms-are">proven fossil fuels reserves are way higher than the amount we can use</a> while having a chance of staying within a 2 degree rise in global temperatures. We simply can&rsquo;t burn what we already have, so finding more seems a wilfully ignorant course.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone can explain to me why we seem so obsessed with propping up the energy status quo, rather than moving forward? The other day, UKIP councillors in Sussex <a href="http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/letters/letter-petition-to-stop-new-wind-farm-1-6195820">voiced strong objections to the new Rampion wind farm</a> which will be built off the south coast, while at the same time their party welcomes fracking for gas and oil all across the Weald, which would be <em>much</em> more invasive. Having said that though, their climate beliefs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKIP#Energy.2C_environment_and_climate_change">absolutely laughable</a>, so we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at such anti-scientific, pro-business posturing. How they are considered &ldquo;anti-establishment&rdquo; is beyond me.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the conservative side of British politics is not concerned with conserving our countryside, our society, our future, or anything else, but instead with conserving the ways that they and their friends got their money and power.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d much rather the country followed the model of Balcombe, right here in Horsham constituency. When presented with the threat of fracking, they didn&rsquo;t just say NO (though they did), they then created <a href="http://www.repowerbalcombe.com/our-mission/">Repower Balcombe</a> to provide 100% of their own energy from renewable sources.</p>

<p>This kind of thinking is how we move forward to the future, not by propping up the profits of outdated energy production industries and hedge fund managers for a few more months.</p>
