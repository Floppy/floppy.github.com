      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the train on the way home from <a href="http://emfcamp.org">Electromagnetic Field 2014</a>. It&rsquo;s a sort of technology / maker festival in a field near Milton Keynes. Imagine a load of tech geeks camping in tents with laser cutters, LEDs, laptops, excellent wifi, and a robot that makes cocktails. It&rsquo;s an amazing place.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to get a speaking slot to talk about my current project, standing for Parliament next year. As it happened, there were two other talks on a similar theme; <a href="https://twitter.com/tom_watson">Tom Watson MP</a> spoke about <a href="/blog/2014/07/14/drip-an-open-letter-to-francis-maude/">DRIP</a>, and <a href="http://www.danjellinek.com/">Dan Jellinek</a> talked about digital democracy ideas and tools, so there was a common thread between all our talks.</p>

<p>All three of us wanted more people to get engaged in politics. Tom Watson went as far as challenging people to join their local Labour or Conservative parties and change them from the inside (which, given enough people, could totally work, though I would like to try a different path).</p>

<p>My talk went down really well, I think. I was very pleased with the turnout, and there were loads of great questions at the end. I came away more convinced that what I&rsquo;m trying to do will resonate with a whole load of people. The new party name that I presented also went down really well, though I&rsquo;ll tell <em>you</em> all about it in a future post &ndash; stay tuned.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BwTPxI5IIAAkHoe.jpg" alt="EMFcamp talk" /></p>

<p>To give people a chance to discuss things further, we held an informal democracy meetup on Saturday evening. I expected a few people to turn up, but we had over 40 and packed out our tent, with standing room only. What followed was two hours of lively debate, discussion, and passion from the people who came along, and I was absolutely blown away by how much people <em>do</em> care, and <em>do</em> want to get involved.</p>

<p>The icing on the cake was Sunday morning. I was walking to get some breakfast and I ran into one of the participants from the night before. He told me that I&rsquo;d inspired him to stand as well, which is just <em>amazing</em>. I&rsquo;ve since had a few others email or grab me around the event saying they want to get more involved and help out somehow. I&rsquo;m &hellip; honoured.</p>

<p>After this weekend, I&rsquo;m even more convinced that this is the start of a movement, the start of something big. The start of something new.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/08/13/leaflet-drops/">Leaflet Drops</a></h1>
      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>This morning, I learnt a bit about leafletting. As a candidate, the bare minimum for a campaign has to be getting a leaflet through every door, so that people are informed of their choices (although a good half the candidates at the 2010 election didn&rsquo;t manage that).</p>

<p>I figured this would be a major cost; I&rsquo;m amazed how wrong that turned out to be.</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>

<p>First things first &ndash; how much will it cost to get these things printed? Ideally I&rsquo;d like to have a 4-page A5 leaflet with full colour printing, and enough for every household in the constituency.</p>

<p>How many is that? Well, let&rsquo;s start with a rough estimate from the 2011 census. The <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/data/area-first/">ONS data explorer</a> makes this pretty easy. You can choose your reporting area by parliamentary constituency, and then find out all sorts of information about the area, including number of households. Turns out, in 2011, there were 43,380 households in the Horsham constituency.</p>

<p>So what will it cost us to print that many? Last night I emailed a request for quotes to four local printers, and was amazed to get back quotes in the Â£1000-1500 range. Considering that party spending on unsolicited mailings was around Â£4500 at the last election, this is a lot less than I expected. I wonder where the rest of their money went? Presumably more than one leaflet; perhaps targeted drops for likely voters.</p>

<h2>Delivery</h2>

<p>This is where it gets awesome. As a parliamentary candidate, you get one free mailing from the Royal Mail. That&rsquo;s right, <em>free</em>.</p>

<p>You can choose addressed mailings to every voter, or an unaddressed mailing to each household (i.e. a normal leaflet drop). The Royal Mail have <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/specialist-services/candidate-mailing">a special candidate mailing area on their website</a> all about this, and so I had a read and phoned up their election people, who were <em>very</em> helpful.</p>

<p>The way it works is; a few weeks before the election, you send your artwork to them to check for compliance with the election and postal rules, and once it&rsquo;s approved, you get given a named Election Manager and instructions on where to drop off your leaflets. Simple as that. They also tell you exactly how many you need to print.</p>

<p>After that, you just get them printed, and drop them off at least 7-10 days before the election. They then deliver them over the next week. You can deliver earlier of course, that&rsquo;s just the latest possible date.</p>

<p>They were helpful enough to tell me how many leaflets were dropped in the recent EU elections, which was about 47,300. A bit higher than the census data, but not far off. I&rsquo;d better budget for about 50,000 next year, allowing for new development, etc, but that won&rsquo;t change the figures too much.</p>

<p>They have a <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/CandidateMail_EuropeanElection_Brochure_Mar2014a.pdf">guidance document for the EU elections</a> up on their site. For now, it&rsquo;s good enough to work from; the 2015 election guidance won&rsquo;t be up until next year.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So, all in all this looks pretty easy. If I can raise Â£1500-ish, and design a leaflet (which some of the printers can help with for a little more), I can get the Royal Mail to deliver it, and everyone in the area will get told about me.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t all the printing of course; more will be needed to be able to hand out flyers to people before the final leaflet drop, but it&rsquo;s a great baseline. I thought that would cost a lot more, and it&rsquo;s once again underlined just how accessible this actually is.</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>One thing you really need to know when standing as a candidate is what areas are actually part of your constituency. Constituencies are pretty weird shapes, especially out in the country, and the area is probably larger than you think. So, time to find out for sure.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Ordnance Survey makes this easy. Their <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/">Election Maps</a> service shows all the constituency, ward, and other boundaries you might want in a nice map format. Enter your constituency name in the box, choose the right one, and you get something like this (apologies for the screenshot, there&rsquo;s no way to embed):</p>

<p><img src="/images/horsham_constituency.png" alt="Horsham constituency OS map" /></p>

<p>Now, what I really want is a map on my wall that I can refer to easily. The Election Maps service does have a print option, but it&rsquo;s just to print a single page yourself, and no way is that good enough for what I want.</p>

<p>Fortunately, OS come to the rescue again with their <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/custom-made-maps.html">custom map printing</a>. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no link on the election maps to &ldquo;order a custom map of this area&rdquo; (which would be awesome, OS, if you&rsquo;re listening) so we have to do it manually.</p>

<p>In my case, I found a point roughly in the middle of the constituency&rsquo;s bounding box, Lower Beeding, and I found that at Landranger scale (1:50000), the whole constituency would fit on one map. This probably won&rsquo;t always be the case, but it worked for me. Â£16.99 and 5 days later, and I have an 80x80cm wall map of my constituency is hanging on my wall:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wall_map.jpg" alt="Horsham constituency wall map" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, that custom map doesn&rsquo;t include the boundary of the constituency, so I had to draw it on with a highlighter pen, but it&rsquo;s not a bad solution.</p>

<p>Note: I tried to do this using OpenStreetMap, but I just couldn&rsquo;t work out how. If anyone knows, then please tell me, I&rsquo;d love to have a method of using the open data in OSM to plan my campaigning :)</p>

<p>Another note: Election boundaries are STUPID. Whoever decided some of those shapes&hellip;</p>
