      <p>Earlier this week more licenses were handed out for oil and gas extraction under the UK, and if you live in the Horsham area, it&rsquo;s very likely that <a href="https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/eng/fox/decc/PED300X/licence?LICENCE_TYPE=PEDL&amp;LICENCE_NO=243">Celtique Energie</a> or <a href="https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/eng/fox/decc/PED300X/licence?LICENCE_TYPE=PEDL&amp;LICENCE_NO=244">Cuadrilla</a> now have a right to extract the resources under your home. Also, the government are currently <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/underground-drilling-access">in the process of changing the law</a> so that you won&rsquo;t have the right to object to this if it happens.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to object to fracking &ndash; some good, some bad &ndash; but the one that concerns me most is that <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21577097-either-governments-are-not-serious-about-climate-change-or-fossil-fuel-firms-are">proven fossil fuels reserves are way higher than the amount we can use</a> while having a chance of staying within a 2 degree rise in global temperatures. We simply can&rsquo;t burn what we already have, so finding more seems a wilfully ignorant course.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone can explain to me why we seem so obsessed with propping up the energy status quo, rather than moving forward? The other day, UKIP councillors in Sussex <a href="http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/letters/letter-petition-to-stop-new-wind-farm-1-6195820">voiced strong objections to the new Rampion wind farm</a> which will be built off the south coast, while at the same time their party welcomes fracking for gas and oil all across the Weald, which would be <em>much</em> more invasive. Having said that though, their climate beliefs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKIP#Energy.2C_environment_and_climate_change">absolutely laughable</a>, so we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at such anti-scientific, pro-business posturing. How they are considered &ldquo;anti-establishment&rdquo; is beyond me.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the conservative side of British politics is not concerned with conserving our countryside, our society, our future, or anything else, but instead with conserving the ways that they and their friends got their money and power.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d much rather the country followed the model of Balcombe, right here in Horsham constituency. When presented with the threat of fracking, they didn&rsquo;t just say NO (though they did), they then created <a href="http://www.repowerbalcombe.com/our-mission/">Repower Balcombe</a> to provide 100% of their own energy from renewable sources.</p>

<p>This kind of thinking is how we move forward to the future, not by propping up the profits of outdated energy production industries and hedge fund managers for a few more months.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/07/24/the-machine-that-goes-beep/">The machine that goes BEEP</a></h1>
      <p>I commute into London a few days a week, and my nearest station is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlehaven_railway_station">Littlehaven</a>, a small station on the <a href="http://www.southernrailway.com/">Southern</a> network. Over the last little while, Southern have been introducing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Transport_Smartcard_Organisation">ITSO</a> smartcard called <a href="https://www.southernrailway.com/smart-card/">The Key</a>, which is pretty great. Now that I have my season ticket on one, I don&rsquo;t have a scraggly piece of card in my wallet, I feel safer if I lose  it, I can order tickets quickly online, and other good stuff. In general it&rsquo;s a good bit of kit.</p>

<p>However, there&rsquo;s only one problem. At Littlehaven, the card readers are outside, and whenever I tap in and out, they beep <em>really</em> loudly. It&rsquo;s so loud that it must disturb the people in the houses nearby, especially when they&rsquo;re sleeping with their windows open in the current heat. I feel awful every time I tap in and out, I really do.</p>

<p>When putting these in, there was a failure to think about where these machines were going. On a platform in a large station, or inside a station building, no problem, but out in the open near houses is a bad idea. The externalities weren&rsquo;t taken into account.</p>

<p>This has made me think about how we design and deploy technologies in general. In the past, the technology itself was often the driver of its form and function; nowadays we have a lot more user-centred design going on, where technology is designed to meet the precise and simple need that the user has. We need to remember to widen that though, to consider the wider impact our technologies have on the world around us; we need more society-centred design.</p>

<p>Technology is, I believe, a force for good, but we must remember what a powerful driver of social change it is, and that almost any technology choice has inherent assumptions about the society it fits into. When Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, it came with a built-in set of assumptions about freedom, democratisation of information, and so on (good ones, in my opinion). When we use Facebook, we&rsquo;re buying into the societal assumption that we are not citizens but products, whose information is handed over to trade to advertisers and others to build shareholder value for Facebook, <em>and that that&rsquo;s OK</em>.</p>

<p>Ethics are important in technology; we need to be aware of what we&rsquo;re building and the wider impact it will have on society at large if it succeeds. We can use technology to build a better society, or we can let it evolve along its own lines without making those choices. Personally, I&rsquo;d rather be in a world of well-designed ethical technology that makes the world better, than surrounded by badly-placed machines that go beep.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to see if I can go back to a paper ticket until they turn down the volume. I don&rsquo;t like waking up the neighbours simply to make my wallet neater.</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the archive for other posts.</em></p>

<p>There are a few of common reactions I get from people when I tell them I&rsquo;m standing (though by far the response is positive).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to put down my own responses to them here. Note that the questions aren&rsquo;t direct quotes from particular individuals, they are a kind of merged version of many times I&rsquo;ve been asked the same thing. I&rsquo;ve tried not to caricature them, but they are simplified; apologies if anyone feels I&rsquo;m putting words into their mouths.</p>

<h2>Why Bother?</h2>

<p><strong>Voting doesn&rsquo;t change anything, so neither will standing. And even if you get in, you&rsquo;ll have no power.</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty damning indictment of our system, right there. If voters have no power, and even elected representatives have no power, isn&rsquo;t it time to change that? Thing is, these changes take time and effort, and unless you&rsquo;re going to literally start a revolution out on the streets, what other routes do we have other than voting and standing? No seat is safe if people vote for a different option. It won&rsquo;t be easy, but it is possible if we work together. I know that&rsquo;s optimistic, but what&rsquo;s the alternative other than fatalistic disengagement?</p>

<p>In the end, my response to &ldquo;why bother&rdquo; comes down to this. If your ideal roadmap for the future doesn&rsquo;t include people that you agree with in government at some point, then what <em>is</em> your roadmap? Will you be out on the streets in violent revolution, or will you be running the underground in a police state? Or are you waiting for the established wealth and power of our political class to voluntarily change its mind and go in a direction you like?</p>

<h2>We can work around it!</h2>

<p><strong>We can fix this with technology. Encrypt everything, work around government interference, make it impossible for them to spy on us.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this one a number of times in the surveillance-related conversations I&rsquo;ve been in, and I disagree wholeheartedly. So, encryption is great, and all these privacy-protecting things are wonderful; however, I don&rsquo;t want to live somewhere where it&rsquo;s necessary to use them to protect myself from <em>my own government</em>. I don&rsquo;t want to end up in an encryption arms race against well-funded domestic intelligence agencies, who at the end of the day can come round and arrest me if I&rsquo;m using suspicious anonymous routing software. There <em>are</em> places like this in the world today, and I have no desire to see the UK turning into one of them. It would, quite frankly, be a shitty way to live.</p>

<h2>Why Horsham?</h2>

<p><strong>Horsham&rsquo;s a very safe Tory seat, you&rsquo;ll never win there. Why not stand somewhere else?</strong></p>

<p>This one&rsquo;s easy. I think that the parachuting-in of candidates by central parties is a terrible thing for voter engagement. The idea of candidates working their way up through marginals, then being rewarded with a nice safe seat once they&rsquo;re at the upper end of the party is one of the really bad aspects of our system at the moment. We actually propose in the manifesto that <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto/democracy.html#standing-for-election">candidates must live or work in the constituency they want to stand for, and have done so for a while beforehand</a>.</p>

<p>So, because I <em>live</em> in Horsham, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m standing. It&rsquo;s the place I&rsquo;m a part of, that I call home, and that I care about. Is that enough of a reason? Yes, it&rsquo;ll be a hard fight, but what isn&rsquo;t?</p>

<h2>Why Francis?</h2>

<p><strong>Why are you standing against Francis Maude? He&rsquo;s one of the good guys!</strong></p>

<p>This comes along a lot in the Open Data and civic technology worlds. First, I&rsquo;d refer you to my above answer &ndash; I&rsquo;m standing <em>for</em> a better way of doing things, not <em>against</em> Francis in particular.</p>

<p>I quite agree that Francis has done good things during his time in government. His creation of <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">GDS</a> and the work around <a href="http://gov.uk">gov.uk</a> has been excellent, and I&rsquo;m quite sure that the transformation agenda currently going across the civil service will lead to great things. From what I hear, he&rsquo;s incredibly engaged in these things, and for that I thank him.</p>

<p>Also, his dedication to government transparency is to be lauded (and continued in future). I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have the great job I have now at the <a href="http://theodi.org">ODI</a> if Francis hadn&rsquo;t given his support to the organisation during its formation, so I have that to thank him for as well.</p>

<p>However, and I&rsquo;m being realistic here, if I take Francis&#8217; seat in 2015, then it&rsquo;ll be a sign of a much larger shift in British politics, and it&rsquo;s quite likely that he wouldn&rsquo;t have been in his job any more anyway. The likelihood of the rest of the establishment remaining unchanged, and me just taking out the one good guy in government is <em>very</em> low.</p>

<p>Of course, while he&rsquo;s done good things in the area of online and transparent government, he&rsquo;s been heavily involved in much of the austerity agenda, has made statements about reducing the rights of teachers and others to go on strike, and many other more traditional Tory policies which I don&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>The government&rsquo;s digital and transparency agendas will continue; we shouldn&rsquo;t get too attached to the person running them.</p>

<h2>Apologies (sort of)</h2>

<p>However, I do feel for those who will probably have to have awkward conversations about why one of their own is running against a key figure in government; if I make your life difficult, I can only apologise.</p>

<p>All I can say is that both my current employment and my choice to stand are a natural parts of my own personal trajectory, and that nobody should see it as some conspiracy of a radical think-tank trying to take over the country. If it was, I imagine they&rsquo;d be rather more effective, anyway. ;)</p>
