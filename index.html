      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/01/25/the-open-democracy-stack/">The Open Democracy Stack</a></h1>
      <p>Since I wrote my blog post <a href="/blog/2013/07/05/its-time-to-step-up/">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to step up&rdquo;</a> last summer, I&rsquo;ve got very interested in the concept of Open Democracy, and have been discovering a lot about what&rsquo;s currently going on in this area. This post is an attempt to delineate the various efforts, mainly for my own benefit, but perhaps others may find it useful as well.</p>

<p>There are a number of overlapping concepts. First, we have political parties, with their manifestos. Then we have the idea of a constitution, and finally the policy-making process itself. A few examples:</p>

<h2>Party Manifestos</h2>

<p>Firstly, and most familiar, we have the political party manifesto. My view is that this is a collection of statements that outlines the beliefs of the party, and how it intends to attack problems. It isn&rsquo;t necessarily detailed, or fully costed, but is indicative of the direction that the party wishes to go. The Pirate Party UK will soon be launching their next open manifesto process, and I&rsquo;m experimenting with building a new political platform under the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a> project (an interesting aspect of which is that is designed to deprecate the party system).</p>

<h2>Constitutions</h2>

<p>Then, we have the idea of a constitution. The UK does not have a proper written constitution, but there is a crowdsourcing effort going on at <a href="http://www.constitutionuk.com/">Constitution UK</a> to create one. Interestingly, a lot of ideas that are going into that are ones that I consider far too specific for a constitution, and instead belong in a party manifesto. A consititution should be short, simple, and consist of the basic rules on which we all agree. The constitution can be added to, but it&rsquo;s best to start with something very simple.</p>

<p>Some examples; the structure of Parliament, the role (or lack thereof) of the monarchy, and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">UDHR</a> would belong in a constitution, but things like economic and social policy, including the role of the NHS and welfare state, would not.</p>

<h2>Tenuous Analogies</h2>

<p>To use a computer analogy, if a party manifesto can be considered a piece of software, which the user can choose to run or not, a consitution is more like the OS; a lower-level design that allows the higher-level manifesto to run, and on which all participants in the system agree.</p>

<p>(Obviously, there are many OSes. And we have many countries with different constitutions, so I&rsquo;m sticking with this analogy for now&hellip; let&rsquo;s see where it breaks)</p>

<h2>Open Policy</h2>

<p>Then we have the policy-design level, which is I think what the <a href="http://my.civilservice.gov.uk/policy/">Cabinet Office Open Policy Team</a> is looking at. This is apolitical, driven by the choices made by the electorate, and is about effective implementation of the ideas in a manifesto. In my mind this is like the content that you create using a piece of software. So, it reflects the manifesto commitment used to drive it, but then is richer in terms of how that commitment is implemented, funded, and so on.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The world of Open Democeacy is one with many pieces, and how they all fit together isn&rsquo;t necessarily obvious at the first look. Anyone who wants to contribute to this (including myself) should understand the &lsquo;stack&rsquo; to know which ideas fit where.</p>

<p>And of course, all this could be wrong, it&rsquo;s just my assessment of it. If anyone wants to enlighten me further, please do, and please contribute to all the open democracy efforts that are out there, at whatever level you feel is most appropriate for you.</p>

      <p>Today is apparently <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/world-mental-health-day/">World Mental Health Day</a>, which makes it an appropriate time to talk a little about depression. I was thinking of doing this anyway, but today seems a good day to do it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve suffered from intermittent depression for the last few years. If I&rsquo;ve been quiet on Twitter or GitHub for the last couple of weeks, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m currently recovering from my fourth round; they seem to come on just under every two years, it seems. It&rsquo;s not a pleasant thing to admit to, but I honestly believe that only by talking about our experiences can we normalise this, and when you&rsquo;re in the grip of depression, what you really need is to know that you are <em>not alone</em>.</p>

<p>The first time round, I didn&rsquo;t really understand what was happening. Work was stressful, but not ridiculously so, but I lost the ability to cope with it. I couldn&rsquo;t make decisions, and I remember times when I would have to run away and actually <em>hide in a darkened room</em> for a while when something tricky came up like, I dunno, triaging the Monday morning bug list. Fortunately I worked for a flight simulation company at the time, so dark rooms were in plentiful supply.</p>

<p>Depression, for someone who works entirely in their mind, as we do as creative programmers, is utterly debilitating. Imagine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your mind slows down</li>
<li>You lose the ability to focus, or think straight about problems</li>
<li>You lose the ability to make decisions; even deciding on lunch can be impossible</li>
<li>You lose confidence; feel like you&rsquo;re a fraud, and that you&rsquo;ll be found out</li>
<li>You lose the big picture; you can&rsquo;t hold it all in your head</li>
<li>Anxiety builds, and eventually you find yourself hiding in darkened rooms trying not to panic (and often failing)</li>
</ul>


<p>Our jobs depend on those exact qualities, and often, for many of us, so does our self-worth. I try to compare it to being a sportsman and having a broken leg; it&rsquo;s take you out of the game just as surely, and it robs you of your reason for being just as much.</p>

<p>However; it is manageable. I&rsquo;m still learning, but I am getting better at it. I&rsquo;m spotting it earlier each time, am getting better at warning my co-workers, and have no qualms now with going to the doctor and getting the help I need once it becomes clear. I&rsquo;ve had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram">medication</a> the last three times; I&rsquo;m currently a week and a half in to this round.</p>

<p>The important thing to realise that <em>it&rsquo;s not a failing, it&rsquo;s an illness</em>. Your brain is a big bag of chemicals that govern your emotions; there&rsquo;s no magical soul hiding there, I&rsquo;m afraid. But sometimes those chemicals go wrong. In the case of depression, it&rsquo;s apparently a long-term reduction in the amount of Serotonin in the brain that does it. Your synapses hoover up too much, so there&rsquo;s not enough left in the gaps to conduct the signals effectively. It can be brought on by stress, by exhaustion, by sudden shocks, or even by a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; illness. The brain gets out of kilter, and then just gets <em>stuck</em> in this cycle.</p>

<p>But, as an engineer, <em>I can relate to this</em>. Depression is a <em>bug</em>, not a failure on <em>my</em> part. The medication prevents this serotonin reuptake, and lets your brain recover, and remember how to balance itself. I&rsquo;ve proved this to myself time and again; a few days into the medication, I&rsquo;m <em>back</em>. I&rsquo;m me again. For example, I couldn&rsquo;t have written this two days ago, but today I&rsquo;m feeling more&hellip; <em>present</em>. I&rsquo;m not there yet, but it won&rsquo;t be long now.</p>

<p>The people around you have a huge part to play. You need their understanding, support, and for them to give you time to recover. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to cope with this if not for my family, my colleagues at <a href="http://amee.com">AMEE</a> and the <a href="http://www.theodi.org">ODI</a>, and for a great friend of mine who, many years ago, taught me how depression works <em>before</em> I found out for myself.</p>

<p>There are a few links I&rsquo;d recommend reading about this:</p>

</ul>


<p>That was a bit long, but the TL;DR is this: If you&rsquo;re feeling the symptoms above, then talk to your doctor and <em>get help</em>. It&rsquo;s just a bug, it&rsquo;s fixable, and you are <em>not</em> a failure. If you know someone who seems to be suffering, then try to help them understand what&rsquo;s happening, don&rsquo;t just tell them to &ldquo;cheer up&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>I find the current state of politics in the UK incredibly depressing.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I find myself disagreeing with most of what the Conservative party is doing in government, and in particular with the narrative they are using to justify it. The Liberal Democrats may claim they have moderated the worst excesses of the Conservatives, but have still allowed the near-privatisation of the NHS, and failed utterly to do anything with the concessions they got in the coalition agreement on things like electoral reform.</p>

<p>On the opposition side&hellip; well, what opposition? I personally like Ed, but it&rsquo;s obvious the media have their teeth into him and will never let him have a proper voice. Worst of all, the Labour Party are buying into the aforementioned narrative of &ldquo;this is what needs to be done&rdquo;. They don&rsquo;t challenge the demonisation of the poor, while entrenched power runs off with the money that&rsquo;s being stripped from our welfare state.</p>

<p>Protest votes are heading to the charismatic far right, with the Old Tory caricatures that are UKIP grabbing all the headlines and dragging the entire country down a path that we <em>really</em> shouldn&rsquo;t be considering. The other minor parties are next to useless. The Greens, really the party I agree with most, will always be mired in 1970&rsquo;s style environmentalism, which nobody will ever vote for en masse.</p>

<p>All this adds up to an uncomfortable truth. Nobody in the public sphere in this country is speaking for <em>me</em>. The narrative is about how the past was better, and the present is broken. The people in power seem to lust after the old days of empire, rather than working out how to take us into a bright shiny future.</p>

<p>The problem is; the future isn&rsquo;t stopping. It will change <em>every single institution we have</em>, and we should be getting excited about that fact and making sure it works <em>for</em> us. That&rsquo;s what I dedicate my life to, to making sure the future is a <em>better</em> place for <em>everyone</em>, but nobody in power seems to want to take us there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="/blog/2009/11/10/the-activist-geek-philosophy">written before</a> about a kind of shared philosophy amongst the open society community, but I stopped short of some of the more controversial areas of politics. I think it&rsquo;s time for us to stop doing that. There is an unspoken tradition in our community of trying to be beyond political statements, to fix things from the outside, but the way GDS are reforming the civil service (which I <em>will</em> give the Conservatives credit for, or at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Maude">some of them</a>) has reminded me that in order to truly change the system, you sometimes have to <em>become</em> the system.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a general election coming in a couple of years. Those of us who are looking to the future should have our hands in the game. It&rsquo;s time for our community to grow up, take responsibility, and stop leaving the debate to the relics. We have the tools and the skills to do this, and a lot of allies. We&rsquo;re already changing the world from behind the scenes; it&rsquo;s time to start leading from the front as well.</p>

<p>If someone is already doing something about this, I want to know who. If not, we should get started by setting up a GitHub repository, and get collaborating on policy for a brighter future.</p>
