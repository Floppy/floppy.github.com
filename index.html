      <p>I&rsquo;ve got an exciting announcement to make; <strong>in May 2015, I&rsquo;m planning to stand in the
general election to be MP for Horsham</strong>. I&rsquo;ll be running on the
principles in the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a>,
an open source collaborative manifesto that <em>anyone</em> can contribute to; I&rsquo;m reasonably sure that&rsquo;s a world first.</p>

<h2>Why do this?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist. I look to the future and hope that we can build a brighter, happier, more collaborative, more equal society for everyone, enabled by the best aspects of our technology. I see a future where we can do <em>democracy itself</em> better, where we all have a say in the way we do things together. I realise that&rsquo;s utopian, but I figure that it&rsquo;s better to have a idea of where you want to get to than just stumbling from crisis to crisis without an end goal in mind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion over the last few years that nobody is
representing me or others who are optimistically working towards a better future. I&rsquo;m fed up of the politics of fear, the <a href="https://therearenoothers.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/othering-101-what-is-othering/">othering</a> of the vulnerable, and the misguided doctrine of austerity. I&rsquo;m also frustrated by our lack of sufficient climate action, and our dismal record when adopting supposedly &ldquo;new&rdquo; technologies like the web. The bleak future offered by the current political choices just isn&rsquo;t a place I want to be.</p>

<p>So, I think we can do better, and the right way to deal with that in our current system is <em>provide the option yourself</em> and stand for office.</p>

<h2>Starting something</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m the first to admit that it will be a hard fight; I&rsquo;m standing in a very safe Conservative seat, against Francis Maude, a cabinet minister. However, Horsham is where I live, and so while there are probably easier targets, this one falls to me, and I&rsquo;m ready to take it on.</p>

<p>Also, this isn&rsquo;t simply about winning one seat next May; it&rsquo;s about trying to inspire others to stand across the country on the same platform, and about getting started on the long haul of building a political movement across many years and multiple elections. There is a growing movement towards a more networked citizen-powered form of democracy across the world, and standing on an open-source manifesto is an exciting way to be part of that.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s do it</h2>

<p>In summary; I&rsquo;m not a politician, but I <em>do</em> think things need to change if we&rsquo;re going to build a decent future. If you agree, and like me you can&rsquo;t trust anyone else to fix things for you, stand where <em>you</em> are, and maybe we&rsquo;ll put a party name on this thing.</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s bring an Open Revolution to British politics.</strong></p>

<p><em>If you&rsquo;re in the Horsham area, visit <a href="http://openhorsham.org.uk">openhorsham.org.uk</a> to keep in touch with the campaign when it starts.</em></p>

<p><em>To get involved in writing the manifesto, visit <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">openpolitics.org.uk</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/OpenPoliticsUK">@OpenPoliticsUK</a> on Twitter.</em></p>

<p><em>And finally, you can follow me on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/Floppy">@Floppy</a>. If you want to stand where you are, let me know!</em></p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/01/25/the-open-democracy-stack/">The Open Democracy Stack</a></h1>
      <p>Since I wrote my blog post <a href="/blog/2013/07/05/its-time-to-step-up/">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to step up&rdquo;</a> last summer, I&rsquo;ve got very interested in the concept of Open Democracy, and have been discovering a lot about what&rsquo;s currently going on in this area. This post is an attempt to delineate the various efforts, mainly for my own benefit, but perhaps others may find it useful as well.</p>

<p>There are a number of overlapping concepts. First, we have political parties, with their manifestos. Then we have the idea of a constitution, and finally the policy-making process itself. A few examples:</p>

<h2>Party Manifestos</h2>

<p>Firstly, and most familiar, we have the political party manifesto. My view is that this is a collection of statements that outlines the beliefs of the party, and how it intends to attack problems. It isn&rsquo;t necessarily detailed, or fully costed, but is indicative of the direction that the party wishes to go. The Pirate Party UK will soon be launching their next open manifesto process, and I&rsquo;m experimenting with building a new political platform under the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a> project (an interesting aspect of which is that is designed to deprecate the party system).</p>

<h2>Constitutions</h2>

<p>Then, we have the idea of a constitution. The UK does not have a proper written constitution, but there is a crowdsourcing effort going on at <a href="http://www.constitutionuk.com/">Constitution UK</a> to create one. Interestingly, a lot of ideas that are going into that are ones that I consider far too specific for a constitution, and instead belong in a party manifesto. A consititution should be short, simple, and consist of the basic rules on which we all agree. The constitution can be added to, but it&rsquo;s best to start with something very simple.</p>

<p>Some examples; the structure of Parliament, the role (or lack thereof) of the monarchy, and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">UDHR</a> would belong in a constitution, but things like economic and social policy, including the role of the NHS and welfare state, would not.</p>

<h2>Tenuous Analogies</h2>

<p>To use a computer analogy, if a party manifesto can be considered a piece of software, which the user can choose to run or not, a consitution is more like the OS; a lower-level design that allows the higher-level manifesto to run, and on which all participants in the system agree.</p>

<p>(Obviously, there are many OSes. And we have many countries with different constitutions, so I&rsquo;m sticking with this analogy for now&hellip; let&rsquo;s see where it breaks)</p>

<h2>Open Policy</h2>

<p>Then we have the policy-design level, which is I think what the <a href="http://my.civilservice.gov.uk/policy/">Cabinet Office Open Policy Team</a> is looking at. This is apolitical, driven by the choices made by the electorate, and is about effective implementation of the ideas in a manifesto. In my mind this is like the content that you create using a piece of software. So, it reflects the manifesto commitment used to drive it, but then is richer in terms of how that commitment is implemented, funded, and so on.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The world of Open Democeacy is one with many pieces, and how they all fit together isn&rsquo;t necessarily obvious at the first look. Anyone who wants to contribute to this (including myself) should understand the &lsquo;stack&rsquo; to know which ideas fit where.</p>

<p>And of course, all this could be wrong, it&rsquo;s just my assessment of it. If anyone wants to enlighten me further, please do, and please contribute to all the open democracy efforts that are out there, at whatever level you feel is most appropriate for you.</p>

      <p>Today is apparently <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/world-mental-health-day/">World Mental Health Day</a>, which makes it an appropriate time to talk a little about depression. I was thinking of doing this anyway, but today seems a good day to do it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve suffered from intermittent depression for the last few years. If I&rsquo;ve been quiet on Twitter or GitHub for the last couple of weeks, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m currently recovering from my fourth round; they seem to come on just under every two years, it seems. It&rsquo;s not a pleasant thing to admit to, but I honestly believe that only by talking about our experiences can we normalise this, and when you&rsquo;re in the grip of depression, what you really need is to know that you are <em>not alone</em>.</p>

<p>The first time round, I didn&rsquo;t really understand what was happening. Work was stressful, but not ridiculously so, but I lost the ability to cope with it. I couldn&rsquo;t make decisions, and I remember times when I would have to run away and actually <em>hide in a darkened room</em> for a while when something tricky came up like, I dunno, triaging the Monday morning bug list. Fortunately I worked for a flight simulation company at the time, so dark rooms were in plentiful supply.</p>

<p>Depression, for someone who works entirely in their mind, as we do as creative programmers, is utterly debilitating. Imagine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your mind slows down</li>
<li>You lose the ability to focus, or think straight about problems</li>
<li>You lose the ability to make decisions; even deciding on lunch can be impossible</li>
<li>You lose confidence; feel like you&rsquo;re a fraud, and that you&rsquo;ll be found out</li>
<li>You lose the big picture; you can&rsquo;t hold it all in your head</li>
<li>Anxiety builds, and eventually you find yourself hiding in darkened rooms trying not to panic (and often failing)</li>
</ul>


<p>Our jobs depend on those exact qualities, and often, for many of us, so does our self-worth. I try to compare it to being a sportsman and having a broken leg; it&rsquo;s take you out of the game just as surely, and it robs you of your reason for being just as much.</p>

<p>However; it is manageable. I&rsquo;m still learning, but I am getting better at it. I&rsquo;m spotting it earlier each time, am getting better at warning my co-workers, and have no qualms now with going to the doctor and getting the help I need once it becomes clear. I&rsquo;ve had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram">medication</a> the last three times; I&rsquo;m currently a week and a half in to this round.</p>

<p>The important thing to realise that <em>it&rsquo;s not a failing, it&rsquo;s an illness</em>. Your brain is a big bag of chemicals that govern your emotions; there&rsquo;s no magical soul hiding there, I&rsquo;m afraid. But sometimes those chemicals go wrong. In the case of depression, it&rsquo;s apparently a long-term reduction in the amount of Serotonin in the brain that does it. Your synapses hoover up too much, so there&rsquo;s not enough left in the gaps to conduct the signals effectively. It can be brought on by stress, by exhaustion, by sudden shocks, or even by a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; illness. The brain gets out of kilter, and then just gets <em>stuck</em> in this cycle.</p>

<p>But, as an engineer, <em>I can relate to this</em>. Depression is a <em>bug</em>, not a failure on <em>my</em> part. The medication prevents this serotonin reuptake, and lets your brain recover, and remember how to balance itself. I&rsquo;ve proved this to myself time and again; a few days into the medication, I&rsquo;m <em>back</em>. I&rsquo;m me again. For example, I couldn&rsquo;t have written this two days ago, but today I&rsquo;m feeling more&hellip; <em>present</em>. I&rsquo;m not there yet, but it won&rsquo;t be long now.</p>

<p>The people around you have a huge part to play. You need their understanding, support, and for them to give you time to recover. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to cope with this if not for my family, my colleagues at <a href="http://amee.com">AMEE</a> and the <a href="http://www.theodi.org">ODI</a>, and for a great friend of mine who, many years ago, taught me how depression works <em>before</em> I found out for myself.</p>

<p>There are a few links I&rsquo;d recommend reading about this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://revdancatt.com/2012/07/26/leaving-the-guardian-creativity-vs-mild-depression-the-quantified-self-and-running/">Leaving the Guardian, Creativity vs Mild Depression</a> by Rev Dan Catt</li>

</ul>


<p>That was a bit long, but the TL;DR is this: If you&rsquo;re feeling the symptoms above, then talk to your doctor and <em>get help</em>. It&rsquo;s just a bug, it&rsquo;s fixable, and you are <em>not</em> a failure. If you know someone who seems to be suffering, then try to help them understand what&rsquo;s happening, don&rsquo;t just tell them to &ldquo;cheer up&rdquo;.</p>
